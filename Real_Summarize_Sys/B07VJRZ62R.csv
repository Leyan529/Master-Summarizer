So I‚Äôm at my hotel that requires a web browser to enter guest info to use the internet and I can‚Äôt do it on the god dam device. Thank god I have my PS4 with me because atleast Sony was smart enough to add it into their system. Whoever thought it was a smart idea to remove it when past Nintendo systems had it needs to get fire if they are still at the company. Because this stupid issue beats the whole point of the god dam console, the on the go system is now worst than the PS4 & Xbox because atleast they can be almost on the go as long as you have power & a screen for them.",1.0,negative

"January 13, 2020",It's Nintendo's newest generation console - you know what this is.,"I'm mainly going to list off the pros for this unit, something I like that they did on this generation compared to the other consoles by Nintendo and some gripes.Portability obviously with its docking capabilities - very good move.  The way the Switch locates itself within the dock is a cool party trick.  I like not having to have a rucksack full of gear just to bring my system with.The Joy-Con controllers are passable and you can actually play 2P games with each one.  I do wish they offered a Pro-controller bundled version.The setup of the system is easy, you don't have to fill out another mortgage worth of EULAs to play.For pennies you get a slew of NES and SNES games through Nintendo Online.Mario Maker 2 is pretty fun and I wished more games had BYO levels like it(cue the wave of gamers that will correct me on 20+ games that have their own world-building options. I'm 43 and don't have time for games like I did in my teens.  Let me dip my filthy casual toe back in the game pool now that my kids are grown.)",4.0,positive

I suggest hunting down the physical disks over utilizing the Nintendo store if she'd like to maximize your dollar value in a long run.

I like that the switch has so many options available of controllers. all of the players in my house have been able to find forms that are comfortable for them. As a huge Mario fan there's no other place for me to get these titles. the biggest hit on the system is that many of the streaming services do not have applications or programs available at this time which is just strange to me.,5.0,positive

I have always loved Nintendo products and feel as if they are more suitable for children. With that being said, this system has been nothing but a headache from the get go! The game is glitchy, won't load, or constantly shuts off mid-game. Nintendo has to know the Minecraft game is this way because its been this way for two years with no improvement. We have played on other systems with no problem. We have also had problems with our joy con controllers. The joy stick on both gets stuck in forward and its a pain to get them to connect to the system EVERYTIME! It even doesnt want to connect to it when you slide into the sides to play on the go. Needless to say I feel let down by Nintendo and feel this product is very poorly made. Controllers are also very expensive for this sysyem to not last longer than they did!

My wife and I play every single night and it's great to bring on trips.

"January 8, 2020",Disappointing for me.,"On paper this is such a slick device, and combined with great Nintendo titles this was something I was excited for. BUT this system just isn't there yet. Right now I'm dealing with input lag that goes beyond controller or title specific issues. Right from the get go, setting it up (while in portable mode) felt odd. The touch screen and the attached joy-cons felt a bit slow. The input lag was the same speed as my PS4 with my TVs game mode OFF. Not a huge deal for many who will play most casual games, but annoying enough for me that titles like Cuphead and Enter the Gungeon are hindered. I do wonder if the newer portable only version doesn't have these issues, but I'm mainly interested in this as a home console.And it's online component? They still haven't caught up with Xbox Live from the 360 generation. Not a huge problem with Discord around, but still.Lot's of pluses for this system for sure, but this is mainly a message to people to try out the system first and decide for yourself if the input lag is bad enough to ruin your experience. A lot of people are very satisfied and don't even notice. I can see this not being a problem in games like Pokemon, or Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. I've been playing ""The Touryst"", charming, relaxing, and a nice change of pace from what I usually play.",3.0,negative

"January 8, 2020","Bit of a rocky start but good for now!  Wish it was as sturdy as my old PS2,  now that is a beast...","I bought this system for myself as a birthday present, and I have enjoyed using it!  The controllers took a bit getting used to detaching on and off properly.  I think the main thing is to be careful about what games you buy if the device will be worth it to you in the end, or if you are excited about upcoming games.  I waited to purchase the Switch until I knew there were about ten games I wanted to play and added about three of them into the in initial cost as well.  I‚Äôm pretty picky about my games because I am a casual gamer. Zelda breath of the wild‚Äîwhich I borrowed from my brother later‚Äî is more intensive than anything I have played in YEARS.Games are expensive in physical format, although that is my preference.  There are some cheaper games on the online store.  So far my favorite local game shop does not have any used copies of Switch games although they have everything else.  Maybe some day.I might buy a screen protector for it in the future but have not as of yet.  If your Switch is to see heavy use by an entire family or if as an owner you plan to travel with it I‚Äôd recommend one but that is not the case for me. I did have a problem within a month of ordering the machine where the fan started whirring LOUDLY.  At first only when it was plugged in to charge then all the time when it was at rest, then at last even while playing a game.  I called Nintendo customer service and had it repaired (although I had to send it back three times with the same issue to a radioshack in Syracuse NY.  Last time I sent it in they just replaced the system.)If I have a problem in the future I will request replacement rather than repair, especially if it‚Äôs going back to New York.  Just not happening.  At least customer service was good, but I was becoming a bit disgruntled toward the end there with their techs!  For my troubles customer service gave me a new set of controllers automatically and then later, three months free on the eshop.  Oh, and the second and third shipments were two day free.",4.0,positive

Comes with everything you need except a carry case (which I would recommend instead of putting in your backpack lose) as well as picking up a good sized Micro SD card. I got like a 200gb one for $30-40 so I will never lose one of the tiny came cartridges.It's light weight and feels a little fragile, but not cheap feeling. Just wouldn't recommend dropping it like EVER. Anyway, great for all ages like 8-99yo.

"April 23, 2020","Device 5 stars, software and website zero stars","Cool toy and my child loves it. However, for a child to use it, you MUST make your own Nintendo account as well as a child account, download the app to set some parental controls, then use their website to set another round of parental controls. Really poorly designed and not intuitive. For example, when making an account, it allows you to use Google, Facebook etc instead of setting a unique Nintendo password. Convenient! However, you can‚Äôt buy anything without a parental password, so once you get father along and try to download something, they forgot about the Google sign in and you need to go back to the beginning and set up new Nintendo password for the parent.

"April 23, 2020",Price gouging is dumb,"This price gouging has to stop. You think it's cool to raise the price to something ridiculous during a global pandemic? Because of supply and demand?? That's some crap. I mean amazon itself is run by a terrible person who doesn't care about his employees and I should expect ya'll to allow this because of that. No one is gonna buy from you at such a ridiculous price. I am so fed up with people using bots to buy out the new stock that comes in with these. You think a normal person has 500 dollars to drop on a gaming console?  When the unemployment rate is at an all time high?? Seriously? 299 is already quite a bit to drop, but I'd consider it reasonable for what you are getting. 500 is over the top, maybe, MAYBE if it came as a bundle I could consider it. Thats a very very small maybe. People are dying and people are going nuts staying in their houses all the time. Let the console be the normal price.",1.0,negative

"January 6, 2020",Very Impressed!,"My son has wanted this for the past year.  Before that he wanted the DS.  I was able to hold out on the DS, but when he wanted the switch, it looked like more than just a portable gaming unit.  Saw it at a friends house and was impressed with how you can just drop it in the dock and it will work on the TV.  So much better than having your kids playing on the small screen the whole time.I still was able to avoid getting it until this year.  After hearing much regret from fellow parents, I caved in, but set very strong ground rules.  So far so good.  Hasn't gotten too immersed into it and understands if he doesn't put it down the first time we ask, it will disappear for a few weeks.The unit itself is very impressive.  I like how the  joycons can be used as a single player and then split into two for a 2 player game.  I plan to get one more pair so that we can have 4 small joycons for family play.Overall I would recommend but for young kids 10 and under set strong ground rules.  No playing school days.  Only Fri-Sun AFTER all work/homework is done.  maybe 1 or 2 hrs max per day on the weekend.  AND any time the rule is broken, the switch will disappear for an unknown amount of time!",5.0,positive

"January 3, 2020",Great system!,"I grew up playing Super NES, Nintendo 64, and Gameboy. The Switch is essentially all three of those systems wrapped into one. While traveling, I use the Switch exclusively in handheld mode. However, when I'm at home, this system gives me the option of playing on the TV as well.It comes with everything you need to start playing (except for a game). I've got a couple of games for it and also downloaded free games. I haven't purchased a SD card and haven't had any issues with space. I haven't upgraded the joy cons or purchased a pro controller. My wife and I play Mario on this a few times a week with the joy cons and they work just fine. Obviously, upgrading to better controllers would be more comfortable but it isn't impossible to play without the pro controller.The games are expensive but that is the case for new PS4 or Xbox games as well. Take advantage of the free games that you can download through the Nintendo Store (there are videos reviewing them on YouTube all of the time). I've been able to find cheaper games at GameStop. The longer the Switch is out, the easier it will be to find used games.There are some limitations to the online playability with the Switch. My understanding is that you'll need to join Nintendo Switch Online ($20 a year) in order to play most games online. However, I didn't buy it to play online (assuming that I'd be playing it when I'm in an airplane, road trips, etc.) so I can't really speak in much detail to these limitations.",5.0,positive

The family acct for Switch Online is $36/yr (watch the auto-renewal!) and there are very few games to choose from. I'm sure by the time they actually add the games I'd enjoy, they will discontinue the network like they did with the last Nintendo online network.

"December 29, 2019",Disappointed,"The switch and accessories are cheaply made. My first issue with the the system was the controls.... The controllers are insanely expensive and luckily my wife bought me a extra set of controls for my Christmas present when she bought the switch because within a couple months two of the 4 controllers stopped working. Looked it up and apparently alot of people were having this issue. But was deploying and really wasnt to worried about it. So got back from my deployment and tried to play  my switch on the dock and guess what that decided it wasn't going to work either, looked this up... Guess what alot of people had that same issue too. If I want to replace the dock and one set of controllers it would cost over half the price of the system. Every other system has expensive accessories but I can depend on them to work. But I do love the switch but hate the fact I can't use it on the TV to actually play games with my family which is half of the reason people buy this system... Other wise I would rather stick with my PlayStation for anything at home and only play my switch if I'm out of the house and have nothing to do.",1.0,negative

"December 29, 2019",Game system is great but joy cons are a disappointment,"The game system we received is the newer one with better battery life. However, we've been disappointed with the joys cons. Both right joy cons in the included one and another set we bought would disconnect. If you read online there are all kinds of issues with the joy cons ever since they made the system. There are fewer problems since they updated them, however, the joy cons we received with this system are dated 2017, before they updated them. So, new game system, old joy cons. Seriously disappointed in this. Nintendo is in the process of setting up a warranty repair, but I shouldn't have to do this for a brand new system. The individual set we bought is going back and we purchased new ones in a local store that should theoretically be newer. To initiate the repair Nintendo asked about a hundred questions and 2 hours later the repair is accepted. Not a good setup, in my opinion.",3.0,negative
"December 29, 2019",üëç,The Switch is a great size. In it's handheld form it is still thin enough to fit into traveling cases and bags.

I did a hard reboot and put it in maintenance mode to fix it which only worked for a few weeks.  Now the screen is completely dead.  This really doesn't look good for Nintendo's quality control seeing that the Switch failed to perform out of the box.  Furthermore, I have had read numerous other stories online of people experiencing the same thing.  Nintendo needs to get better hardware and quality control processes.  The last Nintendo system I owned was an N64 which was a brick house and never had any problems.  The Switch just feels cheap.",1.0,negative

Opening this baby was a jumping, dancing celebration. He was very, very happy. The hubby had it up and going easily and quickly, and it went from box to play time in about 30 minutes. Be prepared to spend about $20 at start up to join Nintendo, and you get a couple packs of games, some looked retro to me. The battery life is amazing, seriously. We had a 4 hour road trip getting home after Christmas, and it held the charge the entire trip. Wow! I feel like it was a good purchase.",5.0,positive
"December 28, 2019",Alright,"There‚Äôs a lot of things I like about the Switch, but at the same time, the limited number of interesting titles makes it a glorified dust collector... whenever I actually do remind myself to boot it up and play the titles I do have.",3.0,negative
"December 28, 2019","Great Games and Console, POOR battery life",While I love the games and console I can‚Äôt get over the truly abysmal battery life and charging times. If you‚Äôre playing outside with your brightness any higher than the absolute lowest setting your console will die within an hour. You also cannot charge the console while playing unless it‚Äôs on the dock because it loses battery faster than it charges.,1.0,negative

"December 27, 2019","Awesome device! Controllers are a bit small, but this is an absolute must buy!","For details as to how this item received the given rating, see below:Nintendo did an awesome job in creating a mobile device that connects to a television or other HDMI output. Compared to other systems, the online membership is far less inexpensive, however it does lack additional incentives (comparing to a PlayStation + subscription). It has many games available to download (or can be purchased via physical media). The catalog is extensive and with the online subscription you can get some retro gaming action!The ability to take this with you anywhere, have games downloaded, and be able to hook up to any video output is awesome! Nintendo nailed it with this system. The controls are a bit small (at least for adults), but this can be fixed with the Joy Con comfort grips or via 3rd party accessories.Pros:  Portable.  Long battery life.  Extensive library of games.  Docking station charges unit/controllers and allows external output.  Easy to use and setup.Cons:  Not backwards compatible with existing/owned titles.  At this moment, unable to previous generation games for the Switch (unless ported over specific to Switch or via retro emulator for NES/SNES, but not for Wii U, 3DS, etc).  Packaging had some plastic covers/wrappers.*Note, there are two ratings applied to the reviewed item. ""Product rating"" and ""Packaging rating"". The actual product will not be impacted by the packaging as these are two separate ratings.In regards to packaging, the following are contributing factors against the ""Packaging rating"":  In an effort to globally reduce and promote less usage of plastic, any usage of plastic or non-environmentally safe packaging/products/material will be marked negatively.  Single use items that do not biodegrade or cannot be easily recycled (see point above on plastics).  The packaging rating is being introduced to help drive a shift to more sustainable and environmentally friendly resources.Visit examinators.com for more reviews!",5.0,positive

Not sure why they couldn‚Äôt just discount it at purchase. So inevitably it went wrong and I needed to complain - hence dropping a few stars.

I still don‚Äôt get any appeal to Nintendo? We have only had it open for 2 days and already both JoyCons are complete toast. The drift in both is so bad that you can‚Äôt make right turns playing Mario Kart. I checked the calibration and followed a number of online tutorials for things to try, but to no avail. Come to find out, there is a class action lawsuit against Nintendo for this very problem. Apparently the solution is to send the controllers to Nintendo and wait a month for them to diagnose and maybe repair them. This is probably why I haven‚Äôt thought about the brand Nintendo for almost 20 years since I last owned any of their products. I‚Äôve owned virtually every gaming console created and never once had this issue with any other controllers. If you are so desperate to play outdated video games with Nintendo level quality that enduring this garbage is worth it to you, then more power to you. I‚Äôm fine dumping this console in the trash and going back to forgetting Nintendo even exists for the next 20 years. I‚Äôll stick to Xbox.",1.0,negative

My son opened this for Christmas, was so excited, only to find out that it has no games, not even a cheap little token game, to actually ""get started"".  A quick peak at game prices, and you'll soon realized that you've been duped by Nintendo.  Their games are ridiculously expensive.

"December 26, 2019",Longtime Nintendo guy but this one is a train wreck stay away,Another disaster from Nintendo following the Wii u calamity. Just a mess of a product even for a long time Nintendo enthusiast. Joy cons are a joke. Just keep buying other controllers. Visually mediocre. Avoid at all costs. Nintendo needs an entire regroup as a whole after this one. People will say it's fun but they are lying to themselves. If you grab a couple oversized Wii wheels Mario kart is solid but it's pretty much the same as Mario kart on Wii. The last good product they put out. My advice put the thing up for sale along with your Wii u on offer up or marketplace and dust off your Wii. Cause this is a train wreck from top to bottom. Slow loading visually poor it just goes on and on and on. I will never turn my back on Nintendo due to years of joy and great nostalgia but they are starting to push it,1.0,negative

"December 24, 2019","Slap in face to disabled, or children with learning disabilities","Will be regifting this system. This was purchased by my grandmother for my son with learning disability‚Äôs, it took several months for him to learn the PS4 controller. I have faith in him that with time and constant frustration he experienced. He could learn but I‚Äôm certain he could not learn both. He was SO exited to get a portable system. There is no logical reason other than forcing their product to be exclusive (button remapping is available on every system on market.)",2.0,negative

"December 24, 2019",Great Console for a Busy Life,"When I was little I used to be able to spend all day playing games. Of course as I got older, my amount of free time decreased exponentially. If, like me, you need to balance your job and college life but still want to play games, this console is a really great choice. It's loaded with tons of pick-up-and-play games that are great for quick 30 minute sessions. The handheld mode makes it really accessible and portable, and the new model has a great battery life. My only big complaint is that the controllers when in handheld mode don't always feel securely attached to the sides of the console. There is a small amount of wiggle if you move the console that is not really enough to bog down the experience, but is still noticeable enough to feel sort of cheap. Overall though this is a great console for a busy young adult still trying to find time for their favorite hobby and I highly reccomend it if you're interested.",4.0,positive

"December 23, 2019",More games available so it's worth the purchase,What can I say besides Mario and Legend of Zelda? It's perfect and I wouldn't change a thing because I can't. I don't work for Nintendo.,5.0,positive

"December 23, 2019",One of the most influential devices of the decade,"The product is fine and the shipping was fast.  However, the box was not sealed which indicates that somebody opened the box.  I ordered this to make sure and get the newer switch with the longer battery life and also to get another dock.  I have not done so yet, but I will be checking to make sure that somebody did not switch an old switch of the new switch in my ""brand new""  open box.  It seems quality control was lax here.",4.0,positive
