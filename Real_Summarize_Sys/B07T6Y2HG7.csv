"May 10, 2020",Quality,"So I bought this case probably 7 months ago.( By the way this is my daughters review) So when I got it, it was great! I recommend this case if you are looking to protect your phone. BUt i have noticed that the sides began to tunr yellow. I belive this is because of a chemical in the plastic and the rays from the sun mixing or something. But what i also dislike about this case is that crumbs and stuff can go in the case because of the cracks for the side buttons. Also, i drop my phone a lot but oncxe when i dropped it, it scrached the case really badly also my phone. So make sure that you dont drop it on hrad surfaces. Overall, this is a good case.",5.0,positive

"April 18, 2020",Sturdy with a lot of small details that make it great.,"I’ve been using Spigen for years and their quality just keeps getting better.My last clear ultra Hybrid case was for an LG V20 which eventually yellowed pretty badly. I still loved the case, but the yellowing material was a real downer.So, far this one has held up extremely well and fits very snuggly to the phone.The lip that extends over the screen is just that extra added protection while the corners been a little beefer keeps it from breaking.The small details like the added feet on the back of the case that are hard to see, but make it level with the camera bump just add to the over stability of the device when it’s on a table.I love been able to show off the gorgeous red while keeping it well protected.",5.0,positive

"January 14, 2020",The irony of how this case was scratched immediately,"The case comes with protective film on both sides of the transparent part of the case. Getting the film off of the outside is not a problem, but the inside is not so easy. I had to use my fingernail to get under the film to remove it, thereby scratching precisely what the film was trying to protect!In another example of irony, the edges of the case appear to be for you to get a grip on (in addition to providing protection) are quite slippery in my hands, but the transparent part (what I expected to be slippery) offers a decent grip.Neither of these is a deal-breaker, but they are enough to make my first impression of this case as being a ""meh"".",3.0,negative

Hoping it will be better.",3.0,negative
"January 13, 2020",Amazing!,"It’s a rugged little case. It fits very snug on my iPhone 11 and makes it a lot easier to hold. The sides are made out of a soft plastic, the kind that you just want to scratch! The back has lifted sections at its corners so the camera does not touch anything underneath the device which is awesome.

"January 13, 2020",Sloppy fit,"I can't speak to the protection yet (ideally, I never will be able to :-)), but it seems like it will be good. (In fact, it's a bit thicker than I really wanted, so if you're looking for minimalist/ultra-thin, this isn't it.)What surprised me is the amount of play/movement in the horizontal fit. Each time I handle the phone, the middles of sides move in and out a bit. As far as I can remember, none of the cases I've had, across several phones, have exhibited this non-snug fit.Also, if anyone cares about this detail, the back shows finger smudges pretty badly.This case will tide me over until I find something I like better. (What I really want is a thin one with a built-in port cover to keep out pocket lint, but I haven't found any so far.)",3.0,negative

"January 2, 2020",Spigen just make great cases,"Spigen has been my go-to Apple tech protection for years.  The products consistently outshine their competition in the most important categories quality, durability, and looks/appeal.  This case is no different.I was a bit afraid of the “clear” back at first, but one of my favorite parts about this case now.  It’s sturdy and appealing look at.  I love the lips that protrude from the face of the phone as to provide that little bit of extra protection to the screen.If I were to comment something negative, it would be to make the invention on the camera hole a bit chunkier or thicker, this is just a preference as I’ve had issues with camera scratches in the past, but I understand that most people want the case to be as thin as possible as to not lose the appeal of the phone itself, so I’m not deducting any stars for this.Overall, you’ll like the look and feel of this case and you’ll be glad you have it for months/years to come.",5.0,positive

The backside is also incredibly prone to fingerprints and oil, leading to difficulty maintaining sturdiness at times.

There is a curve around the edging so that the Charles is slightly raised above the screen. I have a Spurgeon case that is similar and it seems to be made of a harder material then these cases although they are both clear cases. I do have to say I was skeptical of the cases doing what they needed to do, but they have already proved their worth.Not two hours after having her phone one of my twins dropped hers face down off a rock that was approximately 4’ high. She laid the phone down on its face and accidentally knocked it down. It landed face down. I was almost afraid to see the screen, but was pleasantly surprised.

"December 12, 2019",Nice looking case but comes with a flaw,This is my third Spigen case for iPhones. The case looks and feels ok. I haven’t dropped myphone yet so I can’t say just how much protection it actually gives. As always I like the price compared to the competitors. One thing I didn’t like is the film they attach to the inside and outside of the back of the case that needed to be removed prior to using. I get that it’s to keep the case from getting scratched up while inside the box but maybe Spigen should have put pull tabs on it to make it easier to remove. I scratched both inside and outside the case trying to remove the protective plastic so that’s a bummer. I would’ve returned it instantly if my son hadn’t already ripped up the box that it came in as I didn’t like that I had to scratch the case with my finger nails to remove the protective plastic. Also the case is a clear case even though I ordered Matte black. Only the sides of the case are Matte Black so that was a little misleading.,3.0,negative

It's raised above both the screen and the camera in the back which is a must-have if you want good drop protection.

"December 8, 2019",Perfect Case,"Crystal clear and let’s the actual phone color shine through. I’ve used this brand on an older Phone with good results. I love the cushioned edges as I dropped a 6S on a tile floor with no cracking or damage. Haven’t had a chance to test out the 11 case but, knock on wood, it will have the same results. The raised edges around the cameras are perfect for protecting them from damage when placing on a table or surface that otherwise might scratch or damage the lenses. FYI, I’m also able to use this case when charging my iPhone on a Qi Certified device with excellent results. All around beautiful design!",5.0,positive

So when I got the iPhone 11 I thought it was a no-brainer to get this case again for my new phone.. I am not sure if there was a redesign or if some corners were cut, but I have to say that the front edges of this case are now feeling very sharp in my hand and uncomfortable.  The front edge that protects the screen used to be rounded and un-noticeable, but this version for the 11 is very ""square"" and the corners feel sharp.  Ouch!  May need to look for a different case.  It does still protect my phone very well and the buttons are all perfectly usable.  My charger fits through the case perfectly as well.  Just cant get over the pain of holding it.",3.0,negative

It’s a little wiggly around the edge so dust gets trapped easily underneath, and then it’s visible beneath the clear TPU. It’s pretty comfortable to hold, so that’s a plus.

"November 22, 2019",Durable and Protects my iPhone 11  Beautifully! Highly Recommend!,"This is the best protective case for the iPhone 11, it fits perfectly and protects very well. I actually own Two of these Spigen cases, my husband and I both have them on our iPhones. I only had my new phone one day and dropped it on the hardwood floor and this Spigen did an excellent job in protecting my iPhone from damage.  I also love how it’s crystal clear and has a nice grip around the edges as well. If you love your new phones color and want to show it off, this is the case for you! It’s just easy enough to remove, but secure enough it won’t just come off by itself.  It is raised in the corners to protect the back of the case and also to be level with the added protective edge surrounding the projected iPhone 11’s cameras.  I also love how the front does not interfere with my glass screen shield and the edges are raised to prevent the screen from touching when you set it down, screen side down. All together I highly recommend this protective case and Spigen in general I like and recommend. Also, I was wondering if being crystal clear it would show scratches.. but after almost a month of use, it is still super clear and not one scratch or scuff anywhere. It’s easy to clean too, you can wipe it with a microfiber or remove it from your phone and wash it with soap and water. Definitely a great buy and a great protective case.",5.0,positive

"November 13, 2019","Mostly good, but one significant con.","Cons:- If you use a glass screen protector like most people, the front lip is too small/short, with a height difference less than the thickness of a credit card (i.e. if you lay a credit card flat on your screen, it'll be higher than the case's rim), so there's not really any protection from face drops.  It's fine if you put it face down on a perfectly flat and clean surface like a table - the screen doesn't touch anything.  But on an uneven surface like a sidewalk or a slightly textured wooden park bench table, or if there's a crumb slightly larger than a grain of sand, there's a high chance the screen will make contact.  Another 1-2mm of rim would be great.Meh:- Back's a bit of a fingerprint magnet.  Comes off with a quick wipe on your shirt/pants/whatever though.- Volume buttons could be a bit more separated to better differentiate them by feel when in your pocket.- Sides aren't super slick, but a bit more texture would be nice for gripPros:- Fits well.  Not so tight you're scared of bending/breaking your phone when taking it out, not so loose you're scared of it coming off in a fall.- Simple classy style.  Subtle branding on a small part of the edge.- Seems like decent (not crazy) drop protection on the sides and back.  Haven't had any notable drops though.- Opening around the lightning port is good sized - shouldn't have any issues with any plugs not fitting.  If anything, might be a tad too wide.",3.0,negative

I recommend the Spigen case. HOWEVER: peeling off the removable protective plastic sheets from front and back of case is difficult. No tabs to start removal peeling. Took me a good 30 minutes to finally ""catch"" an edge of plastic layer to peel it away from case. Be careful when peeling with any type of knife or blade as you may scratch the case plastic.

Also I’m not sure why people would take off a star because it has the brand name on the side of the case? It’s hardly noticeable to be honest I think those people are just being too picky.

I've become accustomed to the great fit, tactile feel of the buttons, and great quality and protection throughout. So far, this case is no exception to that, I'm happy with the protection it offers. The one thing I dislike about this case is the back transparent plastic. It's a very glossy material which really shows off every fingerprint and scratch. Speaking of which, in the short time I've had it, there are a number of scratches on it, which is hard to understand considering it resides alone in a pocket not shared with anything else. So, the scratches it has must have occurred through the pants or incidentally when left on a table. This is the first Spigen case I haven't loved. It's hard to appreciate the aesthetics of the phone when the transparent layer is full of scratches and fingerprints. It really catches the eye and detracts from the appearance. The only thing ""matte black"" about it is the side bumpers. So, in the short time I've had it, I'd give it an A for protection and a D for appearance.",3.0,negative

"October 26, 2019",Buy this one.,"This is in my opinion one of the best cases you can buy for the iPhone. I had mine on my iPhone X for about two years and it survived many falls and keeps your phone in excellent condition without scuffing up the back because there is actually a small gap in between the back of the phone and the case itself. Hoping for the same result with the iPhone 11 version. I recommend the spigen  screen protectors as well. Overall excellent case, very affordable, extremely protective and durable, and nice and slim.

"October 25, 2019",Not a perfect fit,"I’ve been buying Spigen cases exclusively for my phones for about 7 years. The value, quality and fit has always been exceptional. I recently purchased this case for my iPhone 11 and the fit isn’t what I have come to expect from Spigen. I have the non pro iPhone 11 so I did purchase the correct case, however my past cases have always been skin tight fitting the phones perfectly, this one does not, it’s a tad lose and bulky. I almost feel like Spigen has a new manufacturer or something, maybe that’s why it has this new “made in South Korea” label that hasn’t been on the older models I’ve had.

"October 21, 2019",Best one I’ve found by far.,"I can not say enough about how great I think this case is. I had same one for last cell. I actually didn’t realize how much better it was until I bought a similar but less expensive case. The lips were not raised enough for screen after putting on my screen protector. But most noticeable was there was no protection for the camera lens on the back side. I went through all my purchase history to find exactly the brand I purchased last time. I got the  new 11 with 2 cameras and they were so vulnerable in that case. This case has plenty of lip to protect. I used a pencil for the example. Also, no I don’t get anything out of posting this. I just read so many reviews trying to determine what to buy that I understand how helpful a very thorough review is. The last case I had did separate a bit from rubbery sides to hard plastic back after more than a year but it was just a couple inches on the sides. I was still able to use it and it didn’t compromise the look or protection of the case.  Bottom line, I highly recommend this case.",5.0,positive

"October 11, 2019",Frustrating,"I loved Spigen. I've used multiple products of theirs before purchasing this one. Somehow, this clear case has been the most frustrating experience I've had with any phone case I've tried. The protective coating took me multiple youtube videos, wasted productivity time, and cost me several scratches on the brand new case to try to remove. For a clear case, they wrote ""remove coating"" all over the protective layer which makes it impossible to use without removing the coating. Any attempts to remove the coating are difficult. The diagrams are vague, the borders of the layer are confusing. I tried scratching nearly every surface of the case before I could find it. Maybe color it blue or some other tint to distinguish it from the rest of the phone. Not only is it hard to remove the protective coating in order to put the case on the phone, it's nearly impossible to remove the case from your phone if you want to switch cases without damaging the case.

Had to remove the line due to a SIM card issue and it took a hot minute to remove. While I had it out I tried on the other case and immediately returned to this one. This one is a bit thicker, higher bumpers and again, a nice snug fit.  I used to order Spigen cases all the time and strayed a bit. But this is a great case. I also appreciate that the branding is on the inside of the side bumper and isn't raised on the outside to collect dirt and grime. It's barely noticeable for those who dislike branding being too pronounced.",4.0,positive

Will be looking to get a cover similar to Apple silicon one, as the iPhone 11 feels notably thicker than my old 6s+.As other users have noted, the back cover is clear, which I was expecting. Side bumpers are black so if you leave the phone facing up it’s black. I like the black against the red (my phone) showing thru the back. Excellent value to me, that I can keep this in reserve and buy a slimmer case.",4.0,positive

It is thin enough that my phone will still charge wirelessly on its pad and stand. It covers all corners and edges where there is no exposed edge. It comes in premium packaging, which was very impressive. the ONLY downside I can find is that because of the clarity of the back, it does leave fingerprints and smudge spots. That can be easily remedied by a quick swipe across your leg or shirt sleeve, but thought it was worth mentioning. Also, my pop socket sticks to it just fine. And with the case + the swappable pop socket base, it still will charge wirelessly.",5.0,positive

I like the balance of cushioning protection without being overdone and bulky. So the beauty of the phone is not compromised by a clumsy-looking case.

"September 28, 2019","It's ""Okay"", At Best","Had this on my wife's iPhone for about 6 or 7 days at the time of initial review.Pros:1) Good drop protection.  Fits well over the phone and snugly.  Has a soft silicone/rubber over-surface.  Feels like my wife can drop her phone and it will still protected as well as my phone with an Otterbox Commuter.2) Easy to install.  Got it, popped it over the phone, done.Cons:1) The camera port is too large.  In a handbag or pocket with keys, change, zippers, cosmetic products, eyebrow curlers, and what not, the large single opening allows too many things to contact those surfaces.  In my photo you can see my wife's already managed to get some scratches on the camera.  She had this case on it since minute-one of having the phone.  One can argue that she's probably just scratching a protective film that's still over the lenses, but that doesn't change the fact that objects made contact with those surfaces and will likely continue to do so once those protective films are removed.2) No cover for the charging ports.  I'm spoiled by my other brand which has silicone/rubber covers that go over the phone ports.  Those ports attract ALOT of lint over time and these covers are absolutely necessary in preventing that IMO, and this case, like many others, do not have such a cover.3) It's ugly.  Of course this is a matter of personal taste.  But for a $12 case, a bit of ugliness is to be expected I guess.",3.0,negative

Case has a good feel in the hand allowing me to grip the phone so it doesn't slip out. Buttons and access points function well. Laying the phone on the face, the slight raised edges of the case keep the glass from touching the table surface. When resting on it's back, there are 4 corner raised areas to keep the phone raised a bit and cameras do not touch the table surface. I have not experienced drop protection yet with the case, but the TPU edging should help. It's not the most rugged case out there, but for daily use at work and about at the cost, I like it very much. Previously, I used a wallet case which was functional adding space for credit cards, ID, and cash. But it hides the beauty of the phone and can be a bother when taking photos or videos. Taking photos with the simpler Spigen case is a breeze. Love the iPHone 11 wide angle lens and the zoom system transitions between lenses wonderfully.",4.0,positive

"September 25, 2019",Great Phone case (with a few notes),"For the money, I'd say this phone case can't be beat.It shows off the beauty of my wife's purple iPhone 11 while still protecting it from scratches on back and drops.The lip on both the back and front are great.  It's nice to put the phone face down and know that the screen is off of the table.  Same with the back side, keeps the camera off the table or wherever you're setting it down.The only downside is that it shows fingerprints on the back pretty easily, but with a quick wipe off it looks great again.After a week or so of use, there are no scratches on the back side which is nice.Pair this with a screen protector and I'd say you're good to go!",4.0,positive

"September 23, 2019",Affordable & High Quality -- 4.5 stars,"When I preordered my iPhone 11, I also ordered several cases for it. I wanted to have a couple of options to choose from so that I'd have a case on it immediately. This was one of three cases I got, and though I ended up returning it, I liked the design a lot.Pros:- Snug fit for the phone- Smooth edges & nice feel- Lightweight- Showcases colored phone nicely- Side buttons easy to press- All cutouts alignedCons:- Matte black edges are almost too smoothThe only reason I knocked off a star in my rating is because the black edges on the matte black version are so smooth that they are almost hard to grip. I ended up going with a different Spigen case that has clear plastic around the edges where I am handling the phone because that material allows for a slightly better grip. I would imagine the Crystal Clear version of this (on the same listing) would be 5 stars.I really like the feel, weight, and look of this case. It nicely showcases my purple iPhone 11. All the cutouts are correct, and the side buttons are easy to press. The raised front edge and edge around the camera give a nice amount of additional protection. For the price, this is a great case.",5.0,positive
"September 23, 2019",Shows off my new iPhone 11 perfectly and feels protective,"I was looking for a clear case to show off the purple color of my iPhone 11. I wanted it to be sturdy but not too thick, and this really fits the bill for me. I’m hoping it doesn’t yellow over time, so I’ll check back in if my opinion changes.The only thing I don’t love about this case is the wording on the side. It’s not super noticeable, but it does take away from such a simplistic case. I won’t dock points though because for the price I think this case hits it out of the park. I paired this case with a Spigen glass screen protector and am very pleased.Note: the back of this case has another brand’s lanyard product attached with a 3M sticky and it works great. I also placed a Popsocket on this case with no problems.",5.0,positive

"September 22, 2019",The next best thing to a $40 official case,Excellent case for the iPhone 11. The back panel is solid and crystal clear and the sides do not tint the color of the phone. I’ve directly compared this case to the Apple official case and they are basically the same. The only giveaway is the internal branding on the lower sides that is easy to miss. The fit is firm and offers enough confidence to use this case on my phone in any instance. The smooth back panel should easily receive a Popsocket or any form of mounting device.,5.0,positive

"September 21, 2019",Good protection but easily get scratches,"First of all what I like about this case, looks like it gives protection to lenses and phone screen. Buttons and other openings are well designed. Now what I don’t like about it is it get easily scratched on the backside and dust can go inside and also looks ugly with the finger print marks and dust. Also it comes with a protection plastic inside and out, no pull tab or any means to remove the plastic. It was hard to remove it and I was afraid I’ll scratch the case while removing the plastic.

"September 21, 2019",I’ll be switching to a unicorn beetle case,"There’s no way this is going to protect my new phone (my iPhone 7 died...apparently it’s a flaw with the phone, so I had to get a new one and went with the newly-released iPhone 11). Consequently, that meant I needed a new case as well, because I have small hands and frequently drop my phones because they’re annoyingly big and difficult to hold.  I’ve been using my phone with this otter box case for a day, and it hardly offers any screen protection.  There’s just no way this thing is sturdy enough to protect against routine drops.  I’ll be purchasing a tried and true Unicorn Beetle case...you can put your phone through hell and back in those things and your phone survives, unscathed.",2.0,negative
"September 21, 2019",Slippery and Questionable quality,"I have had spigen cases for other phones and have been happy with them but this case falls far short.First the rubberized material that goes around the phone is very slippery, maybe even more slippery than holding the phone itself.  I want the case to help me not drop the phone in the first place.Most important are the corners on the back (as seen in pictures)The corners rise up to for little pockets.  These will undoubtedly get full of dirt.  I can also see what looks like the bare edges of the transparent plastic that covers the back.  Maybe that is adhesive in there?  Or just rough edges?  But it looks horrible.I will be buying a new case from a different brand ASAP.",1.0,negative
"September 21, 2019",Fits great but a bit of a fingerprint magnet,"The case fits great. The TPU bumper around the edge feels good and solid and is grippy without feeling sticky.The clear polycarbonate back is where I have a bit of a problem. It really shows fingerprints all of the time. I’ve had a different clear PC case on another phone and rarely noticed fingerprints on it but maybe it’s more a matter of having a black phone now instead of silver.I also had to really scrub off some stickiness left from the protective films on the clear PC back.Update: I got a Spigen Liquid Air Armor case and like that look and feel better. No fingerprints, less slippery, and being able to see the back of my black phone wasn't as exciting as I thought.",4.0,positive

"September 20, 2019",I would definitely recommend this,I ordered this case for my new purple iPhone 11. It fits like a glove. The cut outs for the controls are correct. The lip of the case does go above the glass screen just enough to provide protection in case it accidentally gets dropped. I have used this spigen case on every phone and now IPad I have owned.

It feels like it will still last several years without issue, because once I noticed that, I haven't seen anything else wrong with it, and it hasn't gotten any worse in the last three months, so maybe it's just that one section that needs to be re-glued.

The clear case that Apple issued for the iPhone 11 is absolutely terrible, but I stuck with it since it cost me $40. After 6 months with it, I finally wisened up and bought a good case for $15. This case is perfect. It does have the lip at the bottom which threw me off for a couple of days since Apple cases are open at the bottom. I’ve had to adjust my “swipe”, but the feel of this case is amazing. The buttons are clicky, and I don’t feel like it’s going to slip out of my hands. Best of all, the case does not squeak when I squeeze it as the Apple case did. This is a definite BUY coming from the Apple sheep herself.",5.0,positive

"May 1, 2020",Better than I remember,"So I will start of by saying that I got a new phone in Feb. I went from the 8 to the 11 due to phone failure. I had this case for my 8 but decided to go originally for a speck case for my 11. I am not gentle with my phones (at work I tend to drop it as I do a lot of physical construction work) and therefore tend to like to overprotect my phone. I had my speck case for about a week before the outershell cracked open. I didn't drop it from a particularly high location or anything and it dropped onto a carpet. So I ordered this one for my phone as it did amazingly for my old phone. So this is more of a review of both the case for the iphone 8 and the iphone 11. For the price and for the durability I am/have always been impressed. I would absolutely recommend it if you dont want a bulky case, but want something that feels sturdy and has a lip to protect both the screen and the camera.

I had one for my Samsung Galaxy 8 and recently bought one for my wife’s IPhone 11 as well. The case is great, well built and sturdy but had to order me another one because this clear case is a finger print magnet. Make the phone look muggy and dirty. No matter how much you clean it after every use it still looks dirty and muggy. Protection is great but if you are a person who hates finger prints and likes to always have your device looking clean this is not the case you want.

I had previously read some reviews that talked about fingerprints staying on the case, but honestly that’s something you will get whenever you get a transparent case for your phone.

I really love the recessed edging on the front of the case that protects it from damage should it hit hard surfaces.

"April 29, 2020",Fingerprint City: NOT matte finish,"Generally, I like Spigen's cases and have owned many of them over the years starting with my iPhone 4. (Wow, that long ago?) Their cases always fit well, last and look good, so I ordered this one from the description on Amazon and my own experiences with previous Spigen cases. This one, however, was a big disappointment because after it came it quite obviously did NOT have a matte finish on the back. Maybe the sides or something, I don't know what they're referring to, but the back section part of the case left all kinds of finger prints from my grubby little hands. That's a deal breaker for me, so back it goes.",3.0,negative

"February 21, 2020",Sturdy and good quality and helps you to have a good grip with your phone,"This is a clear phone case suited for IPhone11 since it’s a clear case and you can clearly see your phone through it, it might seemed at first that it is as if there isn’t any protection from this case but in contrast to that I am surprisingly very impressed with it’s quality because it is sturdy, durable, and very easy to hold and material makes you help to have a good grip with your phone to avoid having accidents like slipping from your hand/ fingers. So for those who like to see their iphone11 and show it’s actual size and apprearance this case is a very good protector.",5.0,positive
"February 21, 2020",I loved it,"If you want to showcase the beauty if your phone, this is the right case for you",5.0,positive
"February 21, 2020",Doesn’t yellow,"It’s a little slippery but I don’t mind that because I put a popsocket on it. Hasn’t yellowed at all like some clear cases do and I’ve had it for about 2 months. My sister got one from somewhere else that yellowed within 2 weeks. So I don’t think this one will go yellow, that alone gets it 5 stars from me.",5.0,positive
"February 21, 2020",Perfect Case,"When I got my new phone, I caved and bought the clear Apple case at the store because I was too scared to leave my phone unprotected, even for a few days. However, I quickly started hating the case. When it was first put on in the store, it was perfectly flush against the phone. It was INCREDIBLY hard to take off, and I wanted to clean it often because it was easy to notice when it was dirty, but the more you took it off, the worse it fit your phone. It would get looser and looser. So after two months, I decided to get a new case. There are lots of highly rated clear cases on Amazon, but I found that some of them would trade gift cards for five star reviews. I’ve used Spigen before and knew I could trust the brand, and I ultimately settled on this one, and I’m so happy I did.I really like the bumpers on the corners of the phone. They’re not very noticeable of bulky. I also love the raised edge around the camera and the screen. I have a screen protector, but I like the extra security. This case is the perfect compromise between slim and protective.My only complaint is that there is text on three of the four sides. I really prefer a minimalist look, and I don’t mind having a little logo or brand name on one edge, but three seems excessive. However, once the case is on, its not as noticeable as you think.I would highly recommend this case to anyone who wants to show off their phone, but doesn’t want to compromise protection.",5.0,positive

"February 21, 2020",Sturdy case but changed color within one month.,"I've been experimenting with a variety of clear iPhone cases.  This has been one of the sturdiest and most protective.  However, all four sides have turned blue in less than one month from keeping my phone in my denim jean pants pockets.  These aren't new, unwashed jeans.  They are aged enough that I haven't experienced discoloration with any other cases.  Also, I find dirt, dog hair, and water gets caught between the case and my phone.  Lastly, three of the four sides have writing on the case.  One side has the brand name (understandable), but another side reads 'Spigen Inc. in Irvine California Made in South Korea' followed by a numerical sequence, and the other reads 'AR Cushion Technology' with an arrow.",3.0,negative

Meaning it would rock on the camera corner every so slightly and it annoyed me. This case, however, they’ve seemed to have solved that problem. It’s a good all around case that protects the phone from a normal fall distance. Dust easily gets in around the phone and under the transparent cover on the back of the phone, taking the case off to clean the phone and case is recommended every other month or so.  I would suggest to try this out. It’s very comparable to expensive name brand covers of the same type. I hope this company doesn’t lose sight and start over charging for their product.

It is the perfect balance of protection and thin-ness. It fits like a glove and looks sleek and professional.

"February 6, 2020",Pretty good with a few setbacks,"I bought this case for my black iPhone 11 because I wanted something durable yet stylish and clean. Here are my thoughts:Pros+ Bumper is smooth, matte, yet has enough grip to reduce slippage+ Simple and clean design fits perfectly with my black iPhone, preserving its mirror-like finish+ Raised edges on the front and back of the phone protect the screen, cameras, and back plate when resting+ All buttons and ports work wellCons- Removing the protective films from the case was a bit of a hassle without any pull tabs so I had to use a knife which left a very small scratch in the backplate- The protective film when peeled left behind a little sticky residue that I had to wipe with lens cleaner- Even when I carefully dusted off the back of my phone before installing the case I ended up with some dust caught in between the two items- Plastic backplate picks up dust and oils relatively easily and visiblyOverall the case seems pretty durable and looks good but the installation could have been smoother and I would have liked the backplate to be resistant to fingerprints.",4.0,positive

First impression was that is very protective, had a good grip and because it is clear it shows off the great color of the phone. It fits perfectly and all the buttons are easy to use. Now using it for over a month I can say that it is definitely very protective because the phone has been dropped several times on hard surfaces. I would definitely buy this case again.",5.0,positive

"April 23, 2020",Excellent Quality,"This is my second case made by Spigen, the first one that I had was for my iPhone 6s, and I used that case the entire four years that I had the phone. This Spigen case is no different. It hugs the phone tightly, and has bumpers in the most likely places for the phone to be dropped, with raised edges around the camera and all four corners on the back of the phone, protecting that glass backing. I've been using the case for two weeks, and it has excellent grip and the quality of the materials is high, especially for the price. I WOULD NOT buy a more expensive case knowing that a case like this exists. Five stars, through and through. Next time I upgrade, I'll be getting another case from Spigen.",5.0,positive

He carefully examined the case for this one and the same case sold for the 11pro and then showed us a variety of of different brand cases ranging from $20 to $149 then explained how and why the only case better was the huge $149 otterbox waterproof case. He said that we didn’t even need a front case cover unless we dropped it on rocks because the front overlap and reinforced corners would protect it if we dropped it on concrete and even showed us how much better our case is compared to the case that claims it could be dropped off a two story balcony and protect the phone from dropping it wasn’t as good!

"January 21, 2020",Looks nice!,"I like how this feels and look. Is not clear, is mostly a dark red that covers the real color of  my phone, but the edges and camera window are a darker tone and I like it. The reason for drop to 4 stars is that the bottom part for the lighting cable feels weak and I will see the durability over the time. I will update my review in a couple months.",4.0,positive

"January 21, 2020","Looks good, so-so protection, painful on the ear.","Pros:- Inexpensive- Looks good- Camera protectedCons:- Inadequate protection for front screen- Extremely uncomfortable on the ear when taking phone calls- Difficult to find the edges of the screen protectorsI ordered this Spiegen case yesterday and it arrived this morning.  Thank goodness for speedy Amazon shipping.I have posted a video and a few pictures.  Apologies for the lack of quality in the video - it is the first unboxing one I made.The case came in a box in good condition.  The edges of the front and back protective films were difficult to find - it took a few minutes to find the edge - but once I found them the film came off easily.  As you can see in the video the case snapped on quickly and easily, even for someone doing it one-handed.  The photos show all the buttons and cutouts line up very well. The buttons have a nice click to them.  The cutout around the camera is well raised to protect the camera, and I was impressed with that.I am not so impressed for the protection for the front screen, however. I would prefer the lip raised a little more to provide greater protection.  It is extremely minimal and frankly I am sure will provide zero protection for the front of the phone should it fall.The case looks good and shows off the colour of the phone...I'm just extremely skeptical about how much protection it will practically provide.Just before I posted this review I received a phone call and I'm so glad I did as I was able to feel the comfort of the case up against my ear.  YIKES.  The edge is extremely uncomfortable and hurt my ear.  I ended up having to hold the phone away from my ear because it was painful.I can't speak to yellowing, of course, as I've had it in my possession for all of 30 minutes.  No yellowing after 30 minutes though! =D",2.0,negative

"January 20, 2020",So far so good,I’ve had this for a few weeks now and so far I am happy with it although I haven’t done much dropping of the phone yet. It came with clear stickers on both the inside and outside of the case. These stickers were very difficult for me to remove but I finally managed to do it. Then I saw why they were there...this case shows every fingerprint! A little disappointing because it always looks kind of dirty. It does have a raised lip around the screen and camera cut out so I do expect good protection. One thing that worries me is just how big the camera cutout is. I feel like this is just asking for something to happen if/when I drop my phone. Although I am really not sure what can be done about this due to the size of the camera on the phone. So far I am pretty happy. I will update if something happens.,4.0,positive

"January 20, 2020",Better than expected! Highly recommended case for iPhone 11,"I read 100s of reviews before deciding on this clear case for iPhone 11.  Previously, I used a speck case for my iPhone but I didn't like the current cases.  This one is great.  The beveled edges protect the front side and camera when I place it on a flat surface, and I feel like I can easily grip the phone all around.  The fit is perfect all around, and the access points for charging and speakers are clear from any obstruction.  I've dropped the phone from a few feet with no damage whatsoever.  This is an easy product to highly recommend.",5.0,positive
