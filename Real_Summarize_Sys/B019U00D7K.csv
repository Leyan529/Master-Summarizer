"May 11, 2020",Sound Quality Is Magical,"I'm not a frequent headphone buyer, for many reasons, and I'm very picky about sound quality....Let me just say, 20 minutes after testing these headphones right out of the box, I'm already writing a biased review.They were nearly fully charged straight out the package, neatly and thoughtfully packaged with a letter of thanks from the developer, and they have to be one of the most simplistic and welcoming headphone designs I've ever witnessed.They come with a quick step guide and an owners guide, but I didn't need either to figure out what to do in order to get it working.My first sound test was a rap song, and I could feel every single beat. I'm a huge bass guy, so you know I had to test it's might. I went to a subwoofer bass test on YouTube, and I was dumbfounded at the intensity of the bass drops and the crispy clear sounds and clicks. It left me in a minor state of euphoria... just magnificent.Now, this is coming from someone who's never bought anything over 500 dollars.These headphones exceeded my expectations in nearly every way.If I had to come up with a con, it'd be my fault, my head and ears are probably above average size. Even so, it still fit snug on my head and my ears were in heaven.I would say the only step up from these is Bose, and I can say that because my friend spent 300 bucks on one and these were nearly there in quality of sound.Anyways, I've never been this excited to have headphones.

"May 11, 2020",nice headphone,They are definitely noise canceling.  I can't even hear my phone ring sitting right next to it.  My only complaint is the weight of the headphones.  They also tend to press your ears against your head pretty hard causing some discomfort if they are worn too long.  I have had some issues with static when I first connect them to the TV.  I found that turning them off and on again to reconnect solves the problem.  Overall  a nice set of headphones.,4.0,positive

"April 6, 2020","Good electronics, mechanical flaws","I bought two of these about a year and a half ago. The sound is great, the noise cancelling works. They are very comfortable. But, there is a problem. The joint between the earphones and the band is weak and it broke on both pairs. This is the joint that allows the headphones to swivel so you can lay them flat and fit them into the storage bag. My wife's broke after about 6 months. Mine broke recently after about 1.5. years. I have not mistreated them, and looking at where it broke it seems like it's just a weak spot in the design. In both cases, I just glued it back. They still work, but without that joint moving I can no longer put them away in the storage bag.",3.0,negative

"April 6, 2020",Absolute GARBAGE if you watch video - totally useless - and not that great for audio either,"I'm furious.  I have $12 bluetooth headphones that don't have a problem when playing videos but would never believe a $60 set couldn't handle it.  These are total crap.  If you watch a video with the audio streaming through these, there is about a half-second delay between the audio and video so it's like watching a dubbed foreign movie.  Absolutely awful and completely inexcusable.  And how the heck did these get so many 4-star reviews?!?!  They're UNUSABLE for watching movies or TV but even for audio, they're really not that good.  They certainly aren't very loud and the bass is very heavy and 'muddy'.  Oddly, turning on the Noise Cancellation makes them sound better but why should I have to do that?  If you're only gonna listen to music, AND you want to spend twice as much as another headset which would be louder and sound better, go ahead and buy this piece of garbage.  But if you're ever gonna watch video, you're screwed.  I am flabbergasted that this piece of crap ever made it out of the engineering department.",1.0,negative

It gets jittery more often that you'd wish.Mic isn't great either. I do a lot of phone calls with a headset and people have been complaining that it's not as good as my previous headset, sometimes they can't hear me.Volume: you have to click and hold UP (?????) to bring the volume down. Who thought of a feature like that? Really??? And hold it down to raise the volume.Worst: there's not way to mute the mic!!PROS:It's affordable.

"April 4, 2020",Great Customer Service,"I bought these for my father who is in his 70s and has to go to dialysis multiple times a week.  He was always complaining about how loud it was with all the machines beeping, people talking (and unfortunately yelling).  He is stuck in that chair for hours at a time but had trouble sleeping or focusing on what he was doing on his computer.  He absolutely loved these headphones.  He used them every time he went to dialysis - he said they were great for keeping the noise out and allowed him to listen to music or watch videos on his computer in peace.  Unfortunately, they broke after only a few months despite him being super careful with them.  The part where one ear piece attaches to the headband broke.  We tried taping it, gluing it . . . it didn't work because the ear pieces swivel.  While the wire was not cut and sound still came through, it was impossible to wear.  When I contacted customer service they immediately agreed to replace the pair, no questions asked, even though I didn't buy the warranty.  He was so happy to get them back.  I was worried that the new pair could have the same issue so I bought him the hard case and I bought the warranty, just in case.  I'm so glad I did, because the new pair ended up breaking in exactly the same way.  I contacted customer service and they said they would replace them again (I had the warranty by that point so there was no question there).  However, I explained the situation and said I was concerned that the headphones would just keep breaking.  They offered to upgrade the pair at no cost to their E7 Pro version.  I was so shocked -- I wasn't expecting that at all.  I guess I just wanted to have it ""on the record"" that there was a defect in case the headphones did break again.  They shipped the E7s straight to my dad and he was over the moon.  He loved how they linked up with his laptop without him having to do anything and he said they sounded awesome.  He's only had them about a month and a half so we'll see how the new ones hold up but I couldn't be happier with the customer service.  My dad didn't want me to keep spending money on headphones and to him these are really a luxury item so it was nice that he didn't have to feel bad when he got his replacements and he truly appreciates them.  As for sound quality/noise cancelling I can't really comment as he's no audiophile but he said they're comfy and they do exactly what he needs them to do.

First thing I did was try them on. They are plastic and feel so cheaply designed. I was willing to let that slide if it helped even slightly with helping him concentrate.

Even before you turn on the noise cancelling you'll notice a big difference in ""quiet"" as the ear cups gently suction around your ears.  Turn the noise cancelling on, and ""golden silence.""  The bluetooth works perfectly with my iPhone and the sound quality is top-notch.  The sound quality for music is also great with or without the noise-cancelling turn on.  You lose a pinch of base with your music when you have cancelling, but barely noticeable.  With music on, unless it's soft orchestrational, there's really no reason to even turn noise-cancelling on since the headphone cups cancel out enough outside noise that the music will override.",4.0,positive

While I would not call these truly ‚Äúnoise cancelling‚Äù, they do cancel out a fair amount of white noise.

I‚Äôve dropped these a few times and am impressed at their durability.Sound quality is also excellent for this price range. They are also very comfortable, though I do need to take them off every couple of hours to give my ear a break.Battery life is excellent!

"April 2, 2020","Good for some genres, less so for others.","I listen to pretty much every genre of music from time to time. And for certain things, like indie rock, electronic, and hip hop music, these headphones sound fantastic. I'm not great with technical terms to describe sound, but they have a very deep sound, where you can hear multiple layers in the music you probably wouldn't be able to with earbuds. I'm usually pleasantly surprised with these genres. Which brings me to the genre I probably listen to the most often, metal. I don't why this is, but metal overall just doesn't sound that good in these headphones. Metal is a genre that demands to be played at the loudest possible volume, and when I attempt that with these, I am still left wanting more. It pretty much isn't possible to turn them up to a level where the music is uncomfortably loud. And that can end up leaving a lot to be desired. I'm sure if I did have technical knowledge I could describe more accurately why these end up sounding pretty flat when I try to listen to metal on them, but I lack that knowledge. So all I can say is that if metal is your primary genre, you might find yourself a little disappointed.That being said, overall they are great headphones, especially for the price. They usually connect really easily, are comfortable my head/ears for hours at a time, and seem to stay charged forever. And I sometimes like to listen to rain sounds while trying to go to sleep. Listen to 8d rain videos on youtube through these is pretty incredible. It really tricks my brain into thinking I'm right there in the middle of the storm. So overall I don't have any major complaints and am satisfied with my purchase, I just wish they had a little bit more range.",3.0,negative

Using any of the other headphones I have (including a few of my gaming headsets), it was hard to pick up some of the smaller sounds in the videos.Even wearing these without sound coming through, you can still hear what is going on around you, but its decently dampened. I will say with the noise cancelling, I can still faintly hear my fingers typing on the keyboard right now, but it is MUCH quieter than it would have been otherwise (I have a loud Keyboard).I wear these at home when I game, and when I am at work, and even just when I want some peace and quiet when  I go visit my siblings back home. Great battery life (using them for 10+ hrs 6 days a week, and I charge them maybe once?) and decently easy setup. You will learn what the beeps mean quickly, I promise.Overall, a great headset.

"April 2, 2020",Do not buy,"I received these headphones and was initially satisfied although the wire included was very noisy and extra cheap.  I didn‚Äôt use them for about month and had to go on a trip so I packed them after charging them over night and tried to turn them on and it didn‚Äôt work. I tried all the suggestions to get it to work and nothing did,  including the passive connection.  One suggestion was to unplug the battery and plug it back in,  so I opened up the side and the battery has no plugs,  just hard wired.  Biggest disappointment as they were comfortable and I bought the corwin matching case. Do not buy. I regret not buying a name brand.",1.0,negative
"April 2, 2020",Amazing quality for $59.99 Noise Cancellation works very well Great WFH option,"I had my reservations for headphones that were only $59.99. Then after I ordered them I saw Cowin has a pro line for their E7. I was nervous these would be cheap or lack quality. While I am sure the Pro model is slight step up, these headphones are AMAZING. I have only been using them for one week. However, I am using them to work from home and they are perfect for this. They will cancel just about any background noise you may have and my coworkers have said my sound quality on calls is great. In terms of Sound Quality I am no expert but I have been enjoying the sound quality. From Bassnectar to Pink Foyd to Kendrick Lamar I have experienced very little muffling and all of the vocals come through very clear. I am someone who always listens to full volume no exceptions. These Headphones I can get away with 50 percent volume and enjoy the music experience.TL;DR- Best Headphones I have ever owned. Great bargain.",5.0,positive
"April 2, 2020",You get what you pay for.,"Overall, a great noise canceling headphone for under $100, but not great when compared to the Sony XM3 or the Bose QC35/700. If you were them frequently, you should probably just get the Sony or the Bose.",4.0,positive

I honestly was going to just live with it so i didn't really expect a follow up for such a minor complaint.So the brand is very trustworthy they make sure your satisfied with your purchase by very quickly getting back to me to offer alternatives or a replacement in the event the headphone I got was a bad lemon.",5.0,positive

"April 1, 2020",This headset was great at first,"[UPDATE: 04/17/2020]Support reached out to me regarding these headphones and offered to give me a replacement headset.

I am quite surprised and want to update my rating to 5 stars. The headphones were really great, but overall I'm more impressed with their support team. I will definitely be buying more products from COWIN if they keep this up!!This headset was great at first. I bought this late in November 2019, but now the headset isn't working as well. When I use the Bluetooth feature for phone calls, the call quality isn't great. If I switch to using an aux cable, people tell me the call sounds distorted or muffled.

The controls on the earphones are also useless. Typically, if I want to use the buttons on the outside, I‚Äôm either trying to pause it, play, adjust the volume or answer a phone call that is interrupting. These buttons seem to do none of this. There‚Äôs an awkward triangle that does different things depending on which point you press. Somehow, I‚Äôm either skipping to a different podcast or resetting to the beginning.

"March 31, 2020","Dollar for dollar, a great set of headphones","I received these headphones about five days ago. So far, I am generally happy with them. However, there are some quirks that would make me consider a more expensive model in the future.The sound quality is good, the built-in microphone seems to be pretty solid, and the battery life is longer than my Airpods. The range is pretty solid. I can walk a good 20 feet away and be on the other side of a tiled wall and still have only a little dropout of audio.However, the pairing process is inefficient.  If I want to switch between my phone, my laptop, and my TV I first have to physically turn off the bluetooth radio on the device that they were last paired with. Then I have to turn off the headphones, turn them back on, pair them with the new device that I want to use, and then try to remember to turn back on the bluetooth radio that I had previously turned off. I think that if I had opted for a more expensive model, it would have had a way to put the headphones into pairing mode without going through all of that.I have also had a few problems with the headphones disconnecting from my MacBook. The laptop still shows them connected, but the audio switches itself from the headphones to my computer's speaker every once in a while. This happens while I am sitting right in front of the computer. When it first started happening, I thought maybe it meant that the battery was low. I hadn't been using them for anywhere near 30 hours after the initial full charge, but I plugged them in anyway and then the disconnect problem seemed to become less frequent.I used the headphones yesterday with a wired connection to my desktop for the first day of Spring quarter classes at the newly-online University of California, and it worked well. I might decide to buy a slightly longer cable at some point so that I am not quite so closely tethered to my desk, but for now I'm happy with the cable that the headphones came with.Overall, I would probably not purchase these again since I will be using them so much over the coming months and the quirks will be a source of annoyance. But if you're just looking for something to listen to music on while you're working out and you're not going to be switching them regularly between devices, I would say that this is a great set of headphones at a low price point.",4.0,positive

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, beginning of march, I turned them on and they were still at 85% battery.

"March 29, 2020",Overall good performance with a weak point,"The reason for my 3 rating is that 2 out of the 3 I purchased broke by snapping at a pivot point. Otherwise, they are a good purchase.I have purchased 3 sets of these over the last few years. (1 for myself, 1 for my wife, and 1 for my son) Overall, I find them to be useful. The sound quality is decent, maybe not perfect, but very good for an average user. I use them at work all the time because I work in an open office setting. I find that the bluetooth function/ pairing also work well and the charge/ battery life is nice. I charge my work ones once or twice a week and get about 10-12 hours of use per full charge.Physically, they are not the most lightweight of things. If I wear them for more than two hours, I can start to feel the weight pushing down on my head and they also start hurt my ears a bit (But I think almost any headphones will gradually start to irritate your ears if you wear them for a long time.) We use them for air travel and they provide above-average sound cancellation.The price point is good too.Anyway, as I mentioned above, the real weakness for these Cowin headphones is that as I have purchased 3 of them over the last 5 years, and 2 of them broke in the exact same way. There is a pivot point near where the headband meets the earspeakers. The pivot point allows the earspeakers to be pivoted and adjusted for better fit. Unfortunately these pivot points also are only anchored by plastic connectors, and from the 3 that I purchased, 2 of them eventually broke at that plastic connector point which renders them pretty useless (In a pinch you can fix the pivot point with duct tape which also you to kind of use the headphone) . So the lifespan I am getting out of these headphones, with careful use, is only 3-4 years.",3.0,negative
"March 29, 2020","Great headphones, needs improved noise cancellation.","There is much to love with these headphones, the really is, especially for the price! They are well designed, and sound and feel great. I work all day with these on. Call quality: The other person characterized it as sounding like I was using the speakerphone option, which we were OK with.Unfortunately, I bought there specifically for the feature of ""active noise cancelation"". When I swith to the NC, IMO I notice the sound quality drop a small amount but don't notice a reduction in outside noise. The construction/design muffles out a good amount of noise naturally, which is nice, but I feel there was just nothing to say is actively reducing outside noise more than the material. Since I have 5 kids at home in the middle of this current medical situation, it leaves me wishing for more. I wish I tried the newer model out instead.",4.0,positive

"March 28, 2020",Decent Consumer Headphones,"As a former audio engineer, I was intreged when I opened the box and saw the card from Bill Conwin, the inventor, who claimed to be an audio engineer himself.  This may have gotten my hopes up, which is where most of my disappointment with these headphones more than likely lies.  So, for this review, my 4 start rating is instead from an objective standpoint that others would find more common ground with.  Once you get past the fancy packaging you get to the surprisingly sturdy headphones and, what I am most impressed with about these headphones by far, VERY comfortable headphones.The functions are all very straight forward and my only gripe thus far is that the volume & song skipping functions are the same button and depend on how long you hold the button.  I keep trying to change the volume level and it'll skip tracks instead, no matter how long I hold it.  This is not every time, at least, so I'll have to be patient when using these.As for sound quality, these are on par with a lot of other consumer headphones I have tried at this cost.  They're great for the price, plain and simple.  However, the so called extra bass is low mids, instead of actual low end, and just causes it to sound more muddy than necessary.  The high end gets lost in the mix which means the slap of pedal hitting the kick drum, the cymbals of a drum set, the dynamics of an acoustic guitar or of the vocals, etc... they are there, but sound like they're being suffocated with a pillow.

They were good sound quality, but horrible product quality. And those cost over 200 new!These are the pair of headphones I expected when I got those. Not only is the sound great, but the headphones themselves feel nice. They fit so comfortably on my ear, and I don't have to worry about my wires getting tangled or yanked, since it's wireless. If I did want that experience though, they still came with a cord to plug them in to a 3.5mm jack, which I appreciate.I would like to talk noise cancelling right about now because, woah are they something else. I've taken 3 long trips with them now, 1 on an airplane, and I was exceptionally pleased with the lack of background noise. But here is the thing, this is without even turning on noise cancelling! While on the plane, I did turn on the noise cancelling to help me sleep, and sleep I did! Like a baby! I would also like to say the other trips were road trips in a car, and I was listening to my own music while other members listened to the radio, and I couldn't hear them talking of the music.If you want to get a pair of headphones that are luxury quality, you should go for these.

The E7 does a decent job at playing music, but its selling point of noise cancellation is mediocre.",1.0,negative
"May 7, 2020","A Fantastic Value, Great Sound and Battery Life!","I saw in many reviews, people claimed that these headphones sounded ""tinny"" or lacking in bass. However, mine I would say probably are a little overdone on the bass! After looking into it I discovered that Cowin revised the E7's around late 2019 with ""Deep Bass"". Essentially they customized the EQ of the headphones to offer more bass.But overall, you really cannot ask for more value for the money. These are simply fantastic little headphones. The plastic build had me concerned at first, but they've been shockingly durable, and the actual band of the headphones is reinforced with metal. The battery lasts several weeks for me on one charge (though, to be fair I am not the most common headphone user these days), and the sound quality is crisp. I almost never have hiccups with Bluetooth. The range is also fantastic, one day I was listening to music from my iPhone 6S while taking out the trash, and only on my way back to the house from the street corner did I realize I'd accidentaly left my phone in the kitchen, and there had been no issue at all!There are issues, of course, but one must temper their expectations for superbness in every aspect at this price. Still, it is worth knowing the downsides, I think, so one can measure for themselves whether they think it is worth it. The Noise Cancelling feature is good if you are watching YouTube or listening to podcasts and such, but I would not recommend listening to music with NC on. The feature does work, I do notice the cutout of droning loud noises, but at the cost of almost all of the fidelity in the low end. The audio acquires that ""tinny"" quality that I assume reviewers experienced with the original model. Fortunately, the headphones are snug and large enough over my ears that I almost never feel a need to turn on NC anyways.Also, while the E7's do offer a wired option for older devices and computers, the headphones must still be charged and powered on to function in that mode. I think it's a bit of a waste and defeats the point of a wired mode - it doesn't matter whether or not it has a wire if the headphones aren't charged. This is particularly odd to me because, well, all the other headphones in the world that can do wired without their own source of power prove it can be done! But in this increasingly wireless world, I have not yet run into any scenario where this power-for-wired requirement has affected me at all. But if that's a concern, you should keep it in mind. If that's not a big issue for you, then absolutely check these out, you simply will not find better quality at this price range!",4.0,positive

It worked well to block out quieter sounds like the washing machine, television and dishwasher but not as great to block out the excess noise on the airplane.

"March 24, 2020",Muddy sound and poor quality mic,"I had high expectations for this set based on reviews.  I knew the plastic would be cheap but I wasn't prepared for how different the sound would be compared to my old corded Sennheiser HD280 Pro and my bluetooth Plantronics sets.This Corwin E7 can get very loud. But I found the clarity to be so poor that I didn't want to use them.I tried doing a video call with two different friends, on two different services, and a phone call over hangouts from my computer.  Both friends said the sound was horrible on their end, meaning the mic on my side was the culprit.  I switched to my laptop mic, and it improved.  I switched to my other bluetooth headset and it improved more.  One friend described the sound from the mic on this Corwin set as ""Worse than a poor quality cell phone conversation""My primary use of wireless headphones is to listen to audiobooks which are mostly mid range spoken word. These headphones make all voices sound like they are trapped inside a bass drum.  Every word sounds ""boomy"" instead of clear.Given all the very positive reviews, I have to assume that at this price point the muddy (but loud) sound exceeds the expectations of most buyers.  But for me, the 8 year old corded set, and 4 year old bluetooth set I have, are both still far better than this new budget ""Over the ear"" set from Corwin.The packaging was indeed very nice.  But I don't use the packaging. I use the headset. In fact the packaging is so nice, I wish they'd skimped a little on it and improved the quality of the headset instead.I'm returning this item.  I almost never return anything because I rely heavily on reviews and usually am not surprised by what I get. In this case I feel that I will not want to use the product at all due to the low quality sound from the speakers and the mic.",3.0,negative

Music sound quality--bass tones are rich but there's less in mid and high tones.

Comfortable.Cons:  Plastic frame feels cheap.  Sound quality is not great.  Thumping noise any time you're walking with them on while listening as they bob up and down (not great for working out or mowing the lawn, etc).",3.0,negative
"March 23, 2020","Good for the price, i guess.....","First of all, i bought this item because of the great reviews and i was needing new BT headphones for work and to communicate via phone and occasionally listen to music....ok, i gave it 2 stars because of the price and its not horrible (just not that good)-The noice cancellation is only good for the noise going out but it do not cancel noice coming in. So if youre talking on BT, the other person will hear you and noice 50 ft away as well.-The sound quality if you're listening to music is completely horrible. The volume can be on max and its not loud at all....-The BT communication is decent, probably the best feature....-It was only 50 bucks, so i can't be too mad...",2.0,negative

"March 23, 2020",Only one device can be paired at a time.,"These are really nice quality headphones.  They fit comfortably and when listening with them, background noise is virtually eliminated . The initial pairing went smoothly once I identified the power switch. (Don‚Äôt laugh! I had not read the instructions)  My only complaint is that I would like to use these in multiple situations. Ex: with my iPad, iPhone, and my TV.  Pairing each of those was not working until I realized that once it is paired to one device, you have to disconnect it before you can pair to another device. This is proving to be a little aggravating.  Maybe this is typical of paired devices? I have paired devices before and have never experienced this problem, but then I don‚Äôt think I have paired any to be used on multiple devices before.",4.0,positive

"March 22, 2020","Low volume, low quality when using mic","I'm pretty unhappy with these headphones after trying them for a day. I will be returning. They are seriously lacking in volume for everything I plug them into. While they do block out noise fairly well (I can still hear myself type while listening to music tho), the audio through them sounds almost muffled and even on max settings (both on the headphones and devices) the volume is not really that impressive. For the amount of money they cost I expected better on that aspect. The bass will rattle your ear but the treble is just awful.The next thing that is a total deal breaker is the fact that when using the mic it switched to some alternate audio channel which is horrible on the audio quality. Some of my applications won't even operate with it correctly, leaving me with on a mic and no headphone volume at all. I've tried to get around it as much as I can but there doesn't seem to be a way to avoid this. Not being able to get full audio quality while using the mic is a huge disappointment and a flaw I can't accept from my headphones, especially when they cost $60+.I also tried to contact their ""support"" on Facebook, which is really just a bot that doesn't respond beyond a few basic pre-programmed commands. I gave it 3 attempts, no response at all. I'll just return these and find something else that can live up to the description and review hype.",1.0,negative

Upon connecting to a device via Bluetooth it makes an odd sounding ‚Äúbloop‚Äù followed by a buzzing noise. While the device indicates that the music is playing, no sound except for the buzzing comes from the headphones.

Noise is reduced in both positions, but I can't say that I hear the effect of active cancellation like I do with my 3M Work Tunes.

I do feel that the sound quality is very nice, but then again I have nothing to compare it to. Moreover, the headphones are quite bulky in my opinion, and if you wear them for longer than probably an hour or so your ears will begin to hurt (as with most headphones I am sure). It is also uncomfortable to put your head in certain positions while wearing the headphones. Another hassle that you should consider is that if you connect the headset to multiple devices, it‚Äôs probably going to be a hassle to get them to connect to the device you actually want, particularly because the device automatically connects to the most recently used device rather than the one nearest to you. Despite all of this, I do really like these headphones and am sure to be using them on any of my upcoming flights.",5.0,positive

"March 18, 2020",Good sound but a pain to connect,"Extensively researched before buying these headphones. They get the job done but have some fairly significant connection issues.Pros:- Good sound. I'm not a sound engineer but I like how they sound.- Comfortable- Afordable- Good battery life- Good connection rangeCons:- The big one is these are a major PAIN to connect. I could not get my Samsung Galaxy S8+ phone to even find them until I researched online and found that you have to unpair and forget ALL your other bluetooth connected devices before it will find and pair with these headphones. Once it is paired you still sometimes need to disconnect other devices to connect the headphones and then reconnect the other devices. On my desktop I frequently have to restart the computer to get the headphones to connect, even if I had them connected, tuned them off, and turned them back on... It is a HUGE hassle and the main reason I give it less stars.- Grip - These are not very useful for exercise (not the primary reason I bought them) If you are in any position, other than stationary and vertical, they will fall off.Overall I would not recommend these.

"March 17, 2020",Great value ruined by a fatal design / quality flaw,"I purchased these headphones after doing a good amount of research: my goal was value for the money, with sound quality and features balanced with low price. The Cowin E7 initially delivered on all of these promises, and the fairly good noise reduction as a real bonus. Unfortunately, at just around the 12-month mark, the product failed spectacularly. The pivot point at the right earpiece sheared off while I was simply putting them on. They weren't dropped, they weren't abused, and they didn't even leave the house. I'm quite disappointed now that I'm examining the break; it's simply a very weak piece of plastic at a critical point. I'm going to have to withdraw my recommendation for this product from my friends and co-workers. The early failure at a critical point moves a 5 star review down to 1 star.",1.0,negative

Usually lasts for more than a full day at the office. (Conversations get very loud and distracting, so the reduction of voices is a nice addition.)The downside to this is the long term sound pressure makes my ears hurt after I've used them for a while, even at lower volumes.This is where the good review ends.The right hinge failed after several months, this is where I learned that this PRODUCT does not have a warranty. Cowin only guaranties this if you buy it from them directly.After 8 months or so, the earpads started deteriorating, with the ""skin"" of the plastic earpads coming off all over my skin. Now the pads on the crossbar are coming apart as well.I will not buy these again.",3.0,negative

I charged the headphones for 4 hours and connected them to my mobile bluetooth. They were simple to set up and work!

"March 13, 2020","Awesome range, great value, very comfortable!","If anyone  knows who Johnny Guru is, I review products the way he does.Noise cancellation: There are 2 modes, BT and NC. I thnk the BT means Bluetooth and the NC is Noise Cancellation. The BT mode is the mode I use because  the NC mode sounds like an old VCR in the background and is quieter with no extra noise cancellation. The BT mode is still cool because I can barely hear my loud powerful PC. I recommend you stick with the BT mode on your headphones. For this category, I will rate this 5/5.Sound Quality/range: They are pretty good for wireless headphones. Same sound quality from 2 feet away or 30 feet away. The sound does NOT degrade when I walk away. 5/5.Bass Quality: If this is what is meant, the sound is very good. 5/5.Value: I have used 30 dollar headphones that were complete crap. I have tested over 200 dollar headphones in the store (the samples). These headphones are very similar to those 200 dollar headphones in terms of grip on your head and noise quality. Do not spend more than this on wireless headphones. ""But, but, but the noise quality and range and battery life"" Come on, knock it off. Charge them at the end of the day. Have YOU tested both 200 dollar headphones, 30 dollar headphones, and these $60 headphones? If you can actually hear any difference between these and the $200 Bose headphones and if you have a $500,000 net worth and you make 6 figures a year, and those headphones are a tiny percentage of your income, go right ahead! I have a part time job in Retail and those $200 Bose headphones would not be a smart purchase for me financially. Plus I hear 0, ZERO, ZILCH, difference. 5/5  for value.",5.0,positive

Most importantly, these things are comfortable to wear. I usually wear glasses and over the ear headphones can become uncomfortable quickly. I can wear these for hours without any issue. The only weak point I've noticed is that when I do take calls while wearing them, people have a tough time hearing me and they pick up a lot of background noise.

My only minor complaint is that they make my head warm when I'm wearing them, but I think just about any headset will do that.",5.0,positive

Metal, not cheapo plastic like most things today",4.0,positive

"May 6, 2020",Excellent Headphones for a Fraction of the Price of Most Big Name Headphone Manufacturer‚Äôs!!!!,"I will start by saying this is my second pair of Cowin E7 Bluetooth 4.0/Active Noise Cancelling/NFC Over Ear Headphones with Deep Bass, Microphone, Extremely Comfortable Protein Earpads with an Outstanding Battery life when using them in Active Noise Cancelling mode, or not. Every manufacturer of headphones and/or earbuds that offer any type of noise cancelling/noise reduction/Etc. feature in there headphones and/or earbuds ALL have to deal with quicker battery consumption when in that mode, noise cancelling mode, versus not turning that function on. I mostly, about 90% of the time, use my Cowin E7 Headphones for watching TV in bed so I do not disturb my wife from trying to get a good night sleep. I also have never used my Cowin E7 Headphones without the ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) feature turned on. Even with the ANC on, which we should all know now drains the battery somewhat quicker than if ANC is off no matter who the headphones and/or earbuds are manufactured by, I still am getting between 36 and 39 hours of playtime, depending upon my volume setting/the louder you turn up the volume - the more it drains the battery, before I need to charge the 750mAh battery. When it is time to charge the battery, it only takes about 4 hours tops to charge the battery fully. The E7‚Äôs are also equipped with an auxiliary in so that you may connect the E7‚Äôs directly to a device for a ‚Äúhard wired‚Äù for lack of a better word, connection if you prefer that type of connection over a Bluetooth or NFC (Near Field Communication) connection. You can also listen to the E7 Headphones while plugged in with the MICRO USB charging cable to your power supply for charging. It charges at a slower rate, but if you absolutely needed to continue to use the headphones after they have run out of juice, you can. As I stated above, I primarily use my Cowin E7 Headphones for watching TV in bed. My bedroom Samsung LED TV from 2012 is an older model without all the bells and whistles that most TV‚Äôs come with today, but the LED picture is still top notch and as good as or better than most TV‚Äôs made today with several exceptions I do admit. But, it‚Äôs still an excellent picture and perfectly fine for the bedroom. One whistle my older 2012 Samsung LED TV does not have is Bluetooth capabilities.  So I purchased a TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter/Receiver with Wireless 3.5mm Audio Adapter, Low Latency, Pair 2 Devices (headphones/earbuds) at Once, Model #: TT-BA08 and connected it to the TV mentioned above and I have basically 0, or almost no visible latency issues whatsoever while watching TV using my Cowin E7 Headphones. For those who do not know what latency is, it‚Äôs when what your hearing through your headphones doesn‚Äôt match up with the person(s) mouth that the words are coming out of that your watching on TV. Really annoying! But, the Cowin E7 Headphones have no problem with latency when used in connection with a TaoTronics TT-BA08 Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter/Receiver. They are very comfortable wearing for long periods at a time, they come with a nice vinyl carrying/storing case, although I would pick-up Cowin‚Äôs Hard Case. They are excellent for taking/receiving phone calls and clear as can be on both, your end with the E7‚Äôs on and the other end where one can hear you talking hands-free & clear as can be, through your E7 Headphones Microphone. At $59.99 (at the time of this review 5/6/2020) they are an absolute steal!! And at 27,922 ratings that average out to give the Cowin E7 Headphones a 4.4 out of 5 stars (at the time of this review 5/6/2020) you can‚Äôt go wrong. How can all of us be wrong, and how can theses Cowin E7 Headphones continue to be an Amazon Best Seller for at least 3 years straight, maybe longer, that I know of?!?! You can‚Äôt go wrong.",5.0,positive

"May 11, 2020",Not noise cancelling,I've tried true noise cancelling headphones and these are not noise cancelling.  When powered on but noise cancelling turned off the microphones let noise in so it's slightly louder than just wearing normal headphones.  When you switch the noise cancelling feature on all it does is turn the microphones off and it's about the same as wearing normal headphones.  You can have a full conversation with someone wearing these things.I'm wondering if the thousands of positive reviews are actual real reviews.,2.0,negative

Decided on this pair because of the active noise cancellation. So far we like them. With no song playing and the mower running, I compared the noise cancellation against a pair of Mpow safety ear muffs with 36 dB of SNR. The E7 seemed to deaden the mower sound about the same as the safety muffs.CONS: They don't look particularly rugged for outdoors work, but they have held up OK after 10 hours of mowing. My wife complains that they slip down a bit, but she has a small head.Overall, quite happy with our purchase.",5.0,positive

For the price, the sound quality is excellent (to my untrained ears) and the noise cancellation really works. They're also very comfortable to wear and easy to set-up, connecting via Bluetooth to my computer and phone with ease. My lone complaint about the headphones is that the microphone audio quality isn't great. I got these headphones for the primary purpose of being able to use them for zoom calls and the like, but the mic sound is a little thin, distant and low volume, so I gave up on using them for that purpose almost immediately-- people couldn't always hear me clearly and when I tested them for myself, recording audio via the headphones, I could hear the problems they were reporting . The fact that I decided to keep them is a testament to their quality as headphones and their relative low price, but I was very close to returning them. If you're looking for quality, bluetooth, noise cancelling headphones, and that's all you need them for, I'd definitely recommend. If you're hoping to make calls, use them for zoom, etc, find another product.",4.0,positive

I know that noise ""cancelling"" is not noise ""isolating"" but there is little to know difference when NC is turned on. You could hear a pen drop as if you never had the headphones on at all. The description says that these headphones filter out low frequency noise but I can still hear the constant low hum of my AC running. I would say they cancel about 5%. Music quality, however, is great. But if you are buying these purely for noise cancelling purposes, steer clear.. buy noise ISOLATION head phones instead.",3.0,negative

"May 4, 2020",Great headphones for the price,"These headphones provide very good overall sound, and the noise reduction feature works quite well. I use them for travel (they are especially good on flights) and for vacuuming around the house. Their over-the-ear design ensures that you can listen to music or podcasts at low volume even when the ambient noise is high. They are an excellent choice for the price point.Some reviewers have complained about the quality of the design, with headphones breaking at the joints. I have not had any problem with this after extensive use over six months. They are not particularly fragile, but you should take reasonable care when handling them.",5.0,positive

I gave them to my husband and he loves them.  They fit him better and he says the sound quality for music is wonderful.  He wears hearing aids in his ears so can't use the in the ear headphones.

And trust me, I've had plenty if hearing tests done recently, it's not a hearing issue. This is kind of a step up from my toddlers volume safe set.

Came over to Amazon and there were tons more reviews, and additional colors. We also discovered that there is a whole family of audio products by the manufacturer. But back to the headphones, these are amazing. They have a cushioned headband that is easily adjustable to the size of any head. The earpieces are very comfortable and cushy, while allowing the sound to pass through clear and crisp. The noise cancellation feature is a bonus and can help in extremely noisy situations where you may want to cancel out certain noises.  Over all these are really priced nicely comparable to higher end models.",5.0,positive
"May 2, 2020",Excellent quality!,"I use these mostly for online teaching and they are super comfortable.  They don't hurt my ears like my old headphones did.

"May 2, 2020",Great pair of everyday casual headphones with a few minor nuisances,"These headphones are pretty good for the price point that they were offered at. I think that the noise cancellation isn't as robust as the technology that Bose uses, but having noise cancellation at all is significantly better than not having it as a person who likes to focus with music on. There have been plenty of times where I couldn't hear what was around me, even when my music was at a moderate volume. The criticisms that I have are pretty minor; you can't use the wired mode without the headphone being on which means that they need to be charged. I think the battery life and charge time are good enough where it shouldn't be too much of a problem most of the time though. I also don't recommend charging while using at low power as the headphones will still blast ""please charge"", interrupting whatever you were listening to.",5.0,positive
"May 2, 2020",Perfect for air travel,I bought these for a planned overseas flight that unfortunately had to be cancelled. However I have since used them for my daily walks. They are light and comfortable enough for wearing long periods of time. I especially like that they are Bluetooth compatible but also have a cord that I use to plug into an old MP3 player. They pared easily and are a great value.,5.0,positive
"May 2, 2020",Almost worth the money.,Hard to hear well on a lawn tractor. Trouble is that‚Äôs why I bought them. Work well and sounds good. Just doesn‚Äôt reduce the noise from the lawn mower as much as I‚Äôd hope for.,3.0,negative
"May 2, 2020",Not good sound quality for the price,I hate giving bad reviews so to have to do this I am pretty disappointed. I won't lie to you. For 60$ it is NOT worth it. You can get a pair of headphones from the thrift store or marshalls or even best buy like skull candy and get the same if not better and LOUDER sound quality. These are NOT noise cancelling. Unless you stay completely still these have a crackling sound that you can hear over your music/audio playing. The bass is not booming. There are vibrations that give the illusion that there is bass but there is no real sound quality that gives you that WOW factor. Also these are NOT loud at all. They are about the same as airpods or regular headphones you can get anywhere. To be honest these were a bit cheaper than the Sony's I was about to buy and the reviews were great so I went with them but I will pay a bit more for the Sony's because I have never been disappointed with Sony's audio. Just add a bit of audio protection and you are good to go. I would not recommend these. I am sorry for the bad review.,1.0,negative

"May 1, 2020",Hard-Wired Connection Does not Support Microphone Inputs,"Although the headphones seem to work via Bluetooth just fine, the active noise cancelling causes you to hear loud feedback with each step. Although the general sound quality over Bluetooth and via the 3.5 mm aux Jack does work, the headset does not have the ability to allow microphone inputs when connected via the auxillary cable. This is a feature that a reasonable person can assume is supported as no publicly available documentation, including the instruction manual; makes clear.When contacting the chat support from the manufacturers website, I was greeted by the automated system and asked what the issue was. It took a bit of time to have an agent respond with a greeting which is understandable. What is not acceptable was that it took 20 minutes exactly to have the agent respond even after 5 minute intervals of attempting to verify that the agent was still present. After explaining my concern of the functionality 3 different ways in order for clarity on the agent's side, I was met with a response that the agent would have a manager contact me during their operation business hours to ""fix"" the issue. Upon questioning how they might fix this issue, the agent replied that they would be fixing the operation manual to reflect that this was not a feature. After explaining to the representative that I did not want to participate in that interaction and would rather have the product returned for a refund, the agent provided the relevant information to proceed. At the conclusion of this interaction, I requested that the agent provide me with a means in which to aquire a copy of our interaction. The agent replied that they would need additional time in which to inquire on how to accomplish this task. After but 5 minutes, and without providing any other information or response, the agent disconnected the chat. At this disconnection, there was no way to further contact the agent, reinitiate a new chat, nor rate the agent. I am hoping that I am able to return the product and will not be purchasing any other products from this company in the future.",1.0,negative

There is an aux cable that works just fine, but I am not able to use a BT mouse and these at the same time, I have to use the aux.

The noise cancellation feature is effective but gets a little obtrusive if you have the volume up really high.The microphone is the one weak point in the headset.

You have to unpair it first. Didn't know that. Obviously this is not a Cowin issue, but one that I wish they had included in their documentation.

"April 30, 2020",Unbelievably good headphones for the price,"These headphones are so inexpensive for a wireless noise cancelling headphone, that I thought they were going to be ""pretty good"" but not great. It turned out that I was totally wrong. Not only do these headphones have fantastic sound quality, they are very comfortable, and have an amazing battery life. I have accidentally left them on multiple times overnight and then still used them for multiple days before a recharge.  My only complaint would be that the dynamic range seems to be slightly reduced when the sound canceling is on. Not a big deal, they still sound great, and are fantastic for airplanes, working from home, or at the gym.",5.0,positive

"April 30, 2020",Good but ... not good enough,"I brought these for work. ESL on-line teacher. My students complained of not being able to hear me clearly.  That was a big disappointment. As much as I liked the look & feel of these headphones, looking great is just not good enough. They have to work. These do not. I need a mic that produces a clear sound.I tested these (Pair A- cowin)  against the pair I was replacing (Pair B -logitech). Pair B, which has a loose head band, still produced a clearer sound. When listening through my monitor, my voice was crisp and clear with pair B. Pair A sounded muffled and the tick tock of my wall clock was heard. I turned on noise cancelation which did not cancel out the sound. I could not hear any surrounding sounds with Pair B - my broken headphones. Guess I will pull out the duck tape, while I continue my hunt for a good quality wireless headset.",2.0,negative

"April 30, 2020",COWIN E7 hands down above the rest!,"This is buy far the best set of headphones I have had for the value! Soft earpieces, fits over the ears perfectly and extremely light weight but durable.  At work the guy who sits next to me has a 200 dollar pair and likes mine better!  I am currently on a business trip and bought a set of JLabs and they are not even close to compare. I'm giving it as a gift to someone since the sound quality is not as good and hurts my ears after about 20 minutes.  Noise cancellation is great even without turning it on since I set under a A/C heat vent and barely can hear it.

They are bulky but that is what I like about them. They are not uncomfortably bulky and they stay in place because they are adjustable. Even though I bought them in black I liked that they came in different colors.,5.0,positive
"April 30, 2020",A+  Very good Bass quality - Noise cancellation is good in most frequencies.,"I have enjoyed this head phone for 4 months (5 long trips by airliner).  It seems to cancel noise well, but the big surprise was the good quality of Bass.  The E7 are worth the money - a small faction of the price of others, and solid performance.  Maybe it could use more High end, but I am an old man and can't hear that range much anymore regardless.  I hope this helps.",5.0,positive

You won't be disappointed.  Great quality.  Kind of big.  I'm okay with that.  tremendous sound.

My colleague recommended the Cowin E7 headphones to me, so I decided to try them out.  These have great sound, the noise-cancelling feature works really well, people that I teleconference with tell me that I sound like I am in the room with them - no distortion, no tunnel sounds, no echoes, etc.  I got the blue ones and they look pretty and professional.  The E7s have the same audio and recording qualities using both bluetooth and the wired adapter (provided). Great product and great price.

The battery is long-lasting (it warns you when low) I use them about 6-7 hours weekly and charge them around twice a month; They sit very comfortably on my head (Weight light) and easily keep on there (unless you turn down the head -or shake it- for a long time) with an easiness operativity.

"April 30, 2020","Comfort, Quality, Value","This is my second pair of E7 noise cancelling headphones. The first set finally started showing wear after a few years of heavy use. I frequently wear them around the job site because I figured they would be more enjoyable than standard ear protection, and they have stood up very well to a lot of use. I finally opted to buy another pair so that I could have a set that looked nice for when I was not on the job site.I have a good friend who has lots of different noise-cancelling headphones, including much pricier name-brands like Bose and Beats. Honestly, neither one of us can tell the difference between those brands and the E7 (except when it comes to price). These deliver a much better quality sound than ear buds or cheap headphones, and I'm buying for quality, not for a status symbol. I think it is a great value for the money!",5.0,positive

"April 29, 2020","Good headphones, but overpriced and not loud enough","I decided against buying cheap bluetooth over ear headphones because I wanted a product that sounded good AND would last a while amidst the coronavirus pandemic. I go on Zoom meetings at least once or twice a day so I use headphones frequently. I got these because they had thousands of good reviews and they were middle-range in price. They did not come with a wall adapter for the USB cable so if you want to plug them into the wall, you have to find your own charging cube. They did come with an AUX cable which is nice, in case I ever need to actually plug the headphones in. They also came with a travel bag which is nice.So first of all, these headphones are HUGE. I look like a pilot with these things on my head. Secondly, they kind of squeeze my ears/head and it kinda hurts. Thirdly, these headphones do a superb job at cancelling any outside noise, but disappointingly the volume does not turn up loud enough. I feel like A LOT of headphones have this issue, including my Bose earbuds. My computer was at volume setting 82 on a scale of 0-100, and I would have considered it ""normal"" volume. I tried to start a return but because these are from a third party seller (the company that makes them), Amazon wants to charge me $7.61 to return the item via UPS, which is annoying. I personally do not feel these were worth the $60 I paid for them, I think $30 is a more fair price.",4.0,positive

They're comfortable, the base is really good and I'm very happy with them.  Charging is easy.  Haven't had to use noise cancelling yet.  I share an office with another person so it can get noisy when they talk.  My old headset was just not cutting it.  But THESE...they have to be right next to me yelling for me to hear them.  I would highly recommend these.  They are half the price of the set my office companion purchased and perform just as well.  Purchased a Bluetooth dongle so now they are cord free and they work GREAT!",5.0,positive

These headphones are comfortable and the noise cancellation works well but.... after about a month or two they seemed to suddenly drop in sound quality for no reason. The audio constantly bounces between ear to ear making them very annoying to use and more recently they have been making an annoying cracking sound in the left ear.

"April 27, 2020",Great Headphones,"I purchased this product in advance of airplane travel (in 2019) as a major upgrade from the earbuds I had been using. The battery charge for the bluetooth lasts a long time, and they recharge pretty quickly. I really enjoy the sound quality, noise cancellation and option of bluetooth or a standard headphone jack, which allowed me to pair with my own devices or to plug in and watch the in-flight movies. I like that the earpieces rotate for flatter storage, but will likely still get the hard-sided case rather than just using the bag that they come with. Since being home, I frequently wear them around the house, not having to worry about minding cords while listening to something and can avoid bothering or being bothered by my roommate while we're working.",4.0,positive
"April 27, 2020",Sound that's mushy and gross and flat,"I'll say this - they're reasonably comfortable.But the sound quality is really awful. It's sort of OK for talking to someone, although even there these sound distinctly worse even than the other cheap headphones I have. But they're absolutely awful for listening to music: just as mushy and gross and flat as I've ever heard. I'm no audiophile, and for $50 or whatever I'm not looking for high quality sound. But I'd like my music to sound like it's not being played under a pillow inside a barrel.As for the microphone - the folks I was talking with using the headphones complained repeatedly that they couldn't hear me, so I had to go back to the microphone inside my laptop, which they said was much, much better.Uggh. Not recommended.",2.0,negative

I bought the E7 Cowin headphones and couldn't be happier.  They are so comfortable and the sound and noise reduction are great.  I can even listen to an audiobook while I mow.

"April 27, 2020",False advertising or defective?,"I am confused by these comments.Back story: 2018 I bought a $200 pair of JVC idk the model and I loved my babies ok? I can ride my bike and talk to people, I have switch my music track, voice commands and all the good stuff. I used my headphones for apps 12-18 hours a day. Charged them two to three times in the week and bass is beyond delicious.But my babies won't stay connected to my devices, they won't charge right any more and they are just ready to be upcycled or whatever people do.Well I dont have $200-300 to slap down for new headphone during this covid situation so for weeks I shopped around for good budget headphones. Reviews. YouTube reviews. Etc etc. And I landed on these Cowins and its other model. And decided to go ahead and try these.I am just seriously confused if I got a bad batch or if these people have never had a serious pair of headphones before.JVC-I can walk all 3,000 sq ft of the house and yard while my phone is in my bedroom.Cowin-Cant walk a meter to the bathroom without music cutting off.JVC-""Yes I can hear you fine"" while riding my bike on a busy street in the cityCowin-""That BIRD!"" ""You can hear the bird?"" ""Yes and it's so loud"" me using noise cancellation while on a bluetooth call, bird is nowhere near me!!!I do like the lightweight and design of these. They are very pretty to look at and they sit so well on my head. The swivel action of the joint is very innovative and keeps wires safe. I like that one button does many functions just wish I could feel what is plus and what is negative. I like that the power button is a switch, reducing unneccessary circuitry for electric buttons. Its what they can be so light.The sound quality sucks. I dont even enjoy my music or movies the way I did because sound is a huge part of the experience and I may just be a spoiled brat that has to come back to reality but I won't accept this as passing.If they will let me send them back for all the false advertisements I will just wait until I get back to work and school and purchase a good pair, might upgrade and get a new JVC. I know they can be trusted to be used for extensive hours for years and still perform.Hope this helps someone like me to not buy these. If you just want a decent pair of headphones get them. For the price point I say they are pretty ok. Better than CVS cheap headphones. Like I said I know that quality comes with a price, so if you want some pretty headphones get them. If you want something that these guys promise, look elsewhere and possibly just save up for the real deal.",1.0,negative
"April 26, 2020",The headphones keep freezing and disconnecting,No matter how many times I reconnect the headphones from the Bluetooth to the Noice Cancellation they freeze and I hear a buzzing noise for a while and they disconnect.

"April 26, 2020",Good Quality,"I bought two pairs at the same time and my boyfriend and I use them pretty regularly. I think the sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is pretty good. I will say that after about 6 months, my boyfriend's headphones would make the sound of turning on when they weren't even being touched. Now almost a year after having them, his pair will CONSTANTLY make that noise when they're off! It's really distracting when you're not using them, but if they're on they are fine. I have had no issues with mine. Aside from that little hiccup, I think they are worth the money.",4.0,positive

"April 26, 2020",Poor Headphone Design.,"I purchased the Cowin E7 headphones on July 15, 2019. Now less than a year later, the headphones stopped working. At first, I thought it was due to a low battery charge. But the headphones would not take a full charge. On closer examination the headband was disconnected to right speaker housing. Only a thin wire kept the two pieces from fully coming apart. The headband uses a plastic plug to attach it into the speaker housing. The design enables the speaker housing to rotate within a fix limit. A metal connector should have been used, instead of a flimsy piece of plastic. The plastic connector wore out in an unreasonable length of time. I cannot recommend this product.",1.0,negative
"April 26, 2020","OK sound, VERY bad functional design","1. The whole thing is black and seems to be designed to make it hard to find the on/off/noise cancelling switch and the charging port in low light.2. They made both sides look almost identical, with a fake button and light on one earmuff and real ones on the other, so you only have a 50-50 chance that you're looking at the correct one during your hunt in #1 above unless you look carefully at the button to see the little Up/Down dots on the real button.3. Adjusting the volume is very cumbersome: You have to click on different parts of a triangular button on the right earmuff for up/down (which you can't see while adjusting volume), and there is no tactile feedback like a bump/indentation to tell you when your finger is in the right place on the button. Also, Multi-clicking doesn't seem to work or works in such small increments that it's useless, and stopping at the correct volume when holding the button is difficult.4. Hard to adjust the headstrap. Keeps falling forward/back when the earmuffs are over ears. Earmuffs are crooked on ears when strap is firmly on top of head.",2.0,negative

The batteries last forever, I charged up before the trip and didnt have to recharge it for several days. The sound cancelation is not very good unless you have something to listen to, then you could ignore anything. The only problem in a years testing is that sometimes it will act like it struggles to connect so like you might miss what that person said on a show but overall it only happens about 10% of the time that I use it so not really worth making a fuss about.Very happy 10/10 would buy again.",4.0,positive

Here are some pro and cons of this piecePros:1. Very comfortable for extended use. I wore them for full 8 hours (doing WFH and using in between office calls and some music) and was great to use2. Nice sound quality.3. Nice battery life.4. Bluetooth connectivity is fast and never got disconnected. I am using it mostly for laptop and not much with my phone, will update review if found any issue with mobile useCons:There are not many cons but here are few1. Battery life indication is not accurate. I was testing how much battery life it consume on long use, so tested on some interval. It kept showing 100% for long time and then suddenly dropped to 50%. I was expecting it to indicate intermediate reading e.g. 80%, 70 % etc. Looked like its only indication part only as battery work great in general2. Bluetooth range is not very large. I had a Logitech one before that has huge range, this one is good for home use, but can not cover more than 30 feet or so.3. Noise cancelling is OK. I mean I usually can't feel huge difference between normal mode and noise cancelling mode.",4.0,positive
"April 25, 2020",Config Hoops,"I purchased the green-ish set. It came in, nicely packaged. The headset had a strong chemical smell that dissipated after 24 hours of sitting out. The material is very soft. The headset fits a little snug, but the pads are just right for the size of my ears. After getting the settings right, the sound is comparable to my JBL Mini Earbuds which I'm pleased about. Haven't had a chance to really experience the noise cancellation.I have Windows 10. There's a compatibility issue which makes the default sound quality for music and videos less than desired. Before getting the settings right, I was so close to initiating a return. It took a lot of reviews searches, some YouTube searches, and finally stumbling on the right settings to get the sound quality right. Click Windows, search for ""Sound, scroll down to ""Sound Control Panel"". In the new window that pops up, ""E7 Stereo"" needs to be connected.Not sure if the settings I tweaked will make mic use any better. When I tried mic use on my Android, my caller couldn't hear me, but I could have been on the wrong mode at the time.

"April 25, 2020",Would Be Perfect If Not For Volume Issues,"I was really looking forward to these headphones :( I ordered them to replace a broken pair of E7s. They broke similarly to how everyone mentions in the reviews, the ear piece separating from the head piece after 6 months. I bought these for the purpose of listening to music at the office, listening to audiobooks at home, and making video conference calls. I was perfectly happy to order a new pair though since they are SO comfortable. They are more comfy than my $150 Razer Thresher gaming headset. I have a large, sensitive head, which means that everything that touches my head gives me a headache after a while. This includes headphones, earbuds, hats, headbands, and even glasses. Finding a headset that is comfortable has always been a priority for me, over sound quality and other features. That is why I love Cowin, their headsets are the most comfortable I‚Äôve tried. They still give me headaches, but it takes a bit longer. The sound is also great and I have never had issues with them before (apart from them breaking).That being said, no amount of comfort is worth the issues I had with these. I could complain about the durability of the materials, or noise cancelling issues, or the extremely limited range of the wireless feature, but my main issue is the volume! I hope this is just an error with my particular set, but I cannot play music at the lowest volume on my phone. The E7s will not work unless I turn then volume up to two, which is louder than I would like it. Even the volume controls on the headset doesn‚Äôt make it better. Also, if I am listening to music, the person next to me can hear sound coming from the headphones. I never had this problem with my old Cowins! I bought these so that I could listen to music at the office, but they are useless if my coworkers can hear them!I really hope these issues are a malfunction with my particular headset, because I really want to get a pair of Cowins that work.",1.0,negative

I made 5 phone calls to different people and only one person said I sounded okay.

At first I was looking for the cheapest pair available but then decided it would be better to invest in a high quality pair. I am so glad I did because these headphones are fantastic!

They tend to be a bit uncomfortable after a couple of hours of use, but most headsets I have used are similar in this respect.  The Bluetooth connection is easy peasy and works like a charm.  I don't use the noise cancellation because the headset shuts out most average household noise without using this feature.

It‚Äôs not even that the headphones get sweaty it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre so heavy and don‚Äôt stay put that it gets to be a hassle wearing them but it‚Äôs doable if you don‚Äôt care to adjust your headphones while you run or never wear them while you bench or do anything lying down or pushing off of the ground. Basically you‚Äôll probably find them annoying but it‚Äôs doable. I just would not ever recommend them. I personally feel like they‚Äôre great for at home use but am currently now shopping for a different pair of headphones that are better suited for physical activity. When I‚Äôm wearing these at my desk and I‚Äôm sitting there doing work at home with these on, they‚Äôre just so heavy it hurts my neck.

"April 23, 2020",Bluetooth is really poor,"These are nearly unusable via Bluetooth.  They'll only connect after an indeterminate number of attempts at powering on.  The headset and stereo features conflict with each other so you roll the dice on having sound or microphone capabilities with each application that you run.  Generally they seem to cut out around 2 seconds after starting a video or anything new as Windows thrashes between the headset and stereo settings.  I could get past all of that if they didn't periodically cut out resulting in any audio becoming progressively more out-of-sync with visuals creating a nauseating experience.  The sound quality on the Stereo setting is pretty good if you ignore the problems though the sound quality on the headset setting is horrible, and that's the only one that has a functioning microphone.  Likewise, the 3.5 mm plug setup seems to work flawlessly for output (don't expect the microphone to work) but I didn't buy Bluetooth headphones to be tethered a foot from my computer.",2.0,negative

They were very comfortable, as I wore them for most of the flight, and the battery life was great as well. The sound quality was top notch for the price range, as I didn't have crazy high expectations. I had a pair of Beats for years, but didn't want to drop that much more money on headphones.Overall, I give these 5 stars for the quality you get at this price.

"April 23, 2020",Working from home with kids?

My company actually purchases these for the in office folks and recommended we buy once everyone was moved to home-based work. My home office is right next to the kid's playroom; thus, when I jump on conference calls or just need to drown-out the world and concentrate, I just slip these babies on. The noise cancellation is incredible - they eliminate almost 100% of the cabin noise on planes, and as a person with inner-ear problems, they actually help me feel less ""ear/listener/noise fatigued"" when I land. Sound quality is also really good, and for the price, you cannot find a better pair of headphones.",5.0,positive

They didn't ask me to leave a review or anything, but I feel like everyone should know these guys are not a fly by night company - even in the middle of a pandemic.I used them pretty much every day at work and for travel (noise cancel is amazing on airplane - you don't realize how noisy it is until you cancel the sound).

"April 22, 2020",Superior Bass to Beats Headphones,"I've owned two Beats bluetooth headphones prior to buying these headphones. Both lasted me several years each. When the second pair finally gave up the ghost, I decided I'd try non-Beats headphones because I was tired of spending two or three hundred dollars for headphones. I wouldn't say that, overall, the sound is equal to Beats headphones; but the bass is certainly much stronger and the rest of the audio spectrum is still excellent. If you like listening to music with a driving beat, for example, I'm listening to AronChupa - I'm an Albatraoz right now, you will be impressed with the quality of the bass. Another pleasant surprise was the fact that I was able to connect to my iMac and MacBook Pro, something neither of my Beats headphones were able to do. I could only connect to my iPhone and iPad. But the Cowin E7 headphones connect to all of my devices, quickly and easily. One drawback is that the headphones are LARGE and honestly look ridiculous when you wear them. If you don't give a damn what people think of you, and care more about sound quality than your ego, or you primarily will be using them at home, I'd strongly advise getting these amazing headphones.",5.0,positive
"April 22, 2020",Okay value,"It's a great buy for the money. You 100% get the hollow can't hear myself breath effect with these. Not noise canceling though. I wear them everyday at work because cubicles- I can still hear a group of people laughing in front of me or my phone ring but I can't hear the train roaring by my window or my keys clacking. It's great for what I needed which is to keep distractions away from me and it does that well! Sound quality is crystal clear! It can get the loudest I've ever heard headphones get but beware people can hear the audio coming from them on the lowest setting. Also, no bass really. Charging cord is literally like 6inches. Not sure why or who thought that would be a great idea but you DEFINITELY can't use them while charging, not because they don't work while charging but because the cord that came with them are as long as a finger. So strange to me.",4.0,positive

"April 22, 2020","WOULD Recommend, BUT..","After about a month of very heavy use, I'm happy with the amount of money I paid for these headphones. They are truly wireless, with a few complaints which I'll address before complimenting them.First complaint is that I think they should come with a Bluetooth USB stick. The product is shipped with only an aux cord, and though they are bluetooth compatible, if your device is not, you must buy a USB Adapter, which causes a lot of glitches with the headset. It takes mine a long time to detect and connect to my adapter, the pause button on the headset isn't functional with my adapter, etc. etc.Second complaint is that they aren't tight to my head. I have a very average-sized head; not too big or small, but if your goal is a headset for physical activity, it's not this one. Push-ups, running, sit-ups, it just falls right off the head. And to add, the build quality won't stand up to falling off of the head many times.Third and last complaint is that you cannot use these headphones while they're charging, which is quite annoying, but the battery life sorta cancels that out, just remember to charge.Now, the good things. This headset, for the money, is absolutely worth it in my opinion. The sound quality doesn't compare to my studio headphones, but I paid exponentially more for those. The sound quality is solid, and the bass is better than I expected. The noise-cancelling is way better than I expected. Compared to anything else in the price range, I'm sure this noise-cancelling is equivalent or better (and again, obviously not nearly as good as Bose noise cancelling or the like). The battery life is impressive. As long as I don't forget to charge these at night, they don't die. The build quality is about what I expected. The casings and most of the exterior is a heavy-duty plastic; not the worst material, but not the best either. Don't abuse these, and you won't have problems. That said, these are VERY comfortable to me. Despite the cheaper materials, which I don't at all mind because this allows lower price point to the consumer, they still don't really budget with the padding. The earmuffs have about half an inch of padding all around, and the headband has a deeper pocket of padding where it sits on the top of the head.TL;DR -- CHEAP, sufficient quality, good noise cancelling, long enough battery life, great overall balance.The pros absolutely outweigh the cons in my personal opinion. Would recommend buying if you're saving money in this department, but still want the convenience of wireless.",5.0,positive

(NOT COWIN) Then I ordered the E7 and it feels great, sounds amazing, and has a sleek look about it. It feels like I'm carrying around something durable when I wear them instead of a hunk of junk plastic.If I have to point out any cons then the mic isn't the best thing in the world and the noise cancellation feature seems to be reversed on the switch I think. Also I'm able to use it for my xbox one with a cable to listen to the console however the mic feature doesnt work with it even if you have a mic cable.

I love that I can use the noise-canceling option by itself, or while listening to music/my audio books.  It is also perfect for my conference calls.  I can focus on the call and not be distracted by what else is going on in my house, especially while my kids are doing all of their Zoom calls for school and gymnastics workouts.

The piece of cheap junk that arrived in the ""gift box"" should have just been filled with horse apples, at least I wouldn't have wasted any further time. Nothing about this set works right. I'm not sure if I got a bad set from the factory, but I don't even want to mail them back for a new pair. I'm just exhausted with trying to manipulate and watch Youtube videos with trying to get these damn things to do anything. I don't want anything else to do with anything these people ""manufacture.""

"April 21, 2020",Good product,"I bought these just before an upcoming flight. My Sony headphones don't have a long battery life and these had such positive reviews, I thought I'd try them out.They are fantastic with two drawbacks - the circle shape is not contour to the ear shape so they can get uncomfortable after a while. Secondly, and most important, you have to turn them on to use them as normal headphones (even if you don't need the noise cancellation feature). For example, if I want to go on a walk and listen to music, they have to be charged to work. With my Sony and Bose headset, I could use a normal AUX cable and they would work like normal (no battery needed). I only needed to charge them to use the NC feature on flights.

If this was all they delivered I'd still give them a five-star review, but they are awesome for making phone calls, like so awesome I use them for almost every call.But the icing on this electronic cake is the Cowin Bluetooth Receiver/Car kit.  I plug it into my receiver, turn it on, turn my headphones on (after shutting off Bluetooth on my phone so it doesn't try to connect to that and get confused) and in a few seconds I'm getting the same amazing sound from my TV and no one else has to hear it.

I started by pairing with my Samsung Note 10+, then loaded my favorite Spotify playlist and my favorite EQ app.  The hum of my 3d printer disappeared, thanks to the active noise canceling and all I heard were crisp clear vocals and deep rich melodies.

"April 18, 2020",I never write reviews. This is a complete ripoff!!!,"I never write reviews. I typically am happy with the products I order from Amazon. But this is beginning to look like a ripoff because I paid a significant amount of money and the product does not work as advertised. I work in the tech industry and, especially in this age, am reliant on remote meetings working correctly. I have had issue with these headphones being detected by the software multiple times! On top of it, for some stupid reason, there are two modes of operation where one is where the audio is bad and what you say into the microphone is heard well, and the other where the audio is horrific and what you say into the microphone is heard well. BUT THE WORST PART of it is abruptly out of nowhere, my laptop no longer detects the E7 Cowin device so I can't even use the wireless functionality anymore.To make a long story short, don't waste your time on some random Chinese product that will break down on you in the most critical times when you're presenting analysis that will make or break your organization. Don't make the mistake I made, and pay for something more reliable.-ET",1.0,negative
"April 18, 2020",Great gift item.,"I bought these for my son as a Christmas gift.  He really likes them for listening to music, shows and YouTube on his phone.  The noise cancellation is good, but he can still hear things around him.  The sound quality is pretty good for the price, but not as good as other cans.

"April 18, 2020",Solid performer at a affordable price point,"Been giving these a good bit of use over the last few months, and I gotta say I'm quite satisfied with the product.  However I would warn away those looking for headsets specifically to use with the Discord application.  I ended up not being able to find a configuration where everything worked while remaining wireless.  However its my understanding that it was related to limitations of Windows 10 and Discord specifically using bluetooths limited bandwidth to multitask.  Given that I'm not holding it against the headset design.For games, music, or TV/movie the sound quality and range is on point and likely beat out any earbud until you get into the real high end audiophile stuff.  There are tons of over-the-ear bluetooth options out there with a really big price range and if you are here looking for a 'mid-range' option then I'd say you are getting your moneys worth and then some.I'm always worried about battery life when considering wireless devices, but the E7s exceeded my expectations.  Even after extended use I've gone days before having to recharge (after leaving them on/connected overnight).  If a heavy user such as myself doesnt feel battery constrained I have to imagine the low to moderate users will be pleased.I tend to neglect my digital devices so I was in the market for something that could take a beating.  So a good balance of average/good performance, but with lower risk of burning money in the worst case. The quality of the actual physical product is decent-to-good, but nothing mind blowing  Really if you want that then you should be looking at top shelf models/brands (ie ~$300+).  At no point did I ever think they felt 'cheap'.  I will say I still find them very comfortable while remaining snug, even in longer sessions (ie hours).All in all, for my first corwin product I was reasonably impressed.",5.0,positive

So instead of ""booming character"" the E7's sound is more like ""buttery smooth"".  Makes them ideal for listening to lofi hip-hops or jazz beats while studying.  Noise reduction feature helps with that too.  It doesn't cancel surrounding noises as much as the ipods; it just muffles and reduces the amplitude of them.

"April 18, 2020",Great and functional,"Overall great, but not quite as much sound cancelling as I expected. It drowns out background noise, but if you're sitting next to people talking, it can't quite cancel out all of that. I got them because I normally work in an office that has an open floor plan, so there's a lot of noise around me. Generally they're comfortable, but I wear glasses, so when I'm wearing my glasses with them, the headphones push on the arms of my glasses and get irritating after a couple hours. Without glasses on, they're much better. Also really love the color of them, and the buttons on the side are super easy to use. I've only used them with bluetooth cause cords annoy me and get in the way while I'm working, so I really love how well they work on bluetooth.

One could not discern the separate instruments in music as one can do on good headphones. Moreover, the volume continually vacillated going up and down.  In addition, the music sounded like it was being played through a speaker covered by a pillow!

"April 16, 2020","Good Product, Great Price","Pros: Bluetooth, Noise Cancellation, Long-lasting battery (I learned the hard way how long the battery can actually last as you'll see in the ""cons"" section), relatively quick charge, very comfortable around ears and on the head, not heavy but not too light (ideal weight), clear sound, very nice packaging with some extras, and the 24-month warranty for only $7.99 is an amazing deal.Cons: Once, the headphones completely died and after overcharging them the Bluetooth stopped working. I did some research and found that I needed to completely drain the battery again by leaving it on NC mode, which took nearly 3 days (about 60 hours), and then I recharged them using the original charger and finally, it was fixed. To avoid this I recommend not allowing the battery to completely die, don't overcharge (charging overnight), and use the original cable.

The cheap ones had very little volume, no noise cancelation, and the battery life per charge got worst with each use.I wasn't going to pay  2 to 3 hundred dollars for noice cancelling headsets to cut grass with.  Based upon reviews, cost, and battery life I purchased the COWIN's.  They have great volume and sound while riding on the mower.  Noice cancelation is a 7 or 8 out 10 while on the noisy mower.  Not sure if any headset could be a 10 in this situation.  I listen to music and/or talk radio while mowing.  The volume and sound quality is very, very good.

"April 13, 2020","Quit Working After a Year, Cowin Replaced No Questions Asked","Update: I contacted Cowin and they are sending me a new pair of headphones. Pretty impressive customer service, especially now that everyone is working from home. I've added a couple Stars due to the great customer service, and their no questions asked replacement.I bought these headphones in March 2019 from Amazon. They've worked well, though the noise cancellation never worked. I don't use them every day but do use them several times a week. The battery charge lasts forever. They worked great until last week when I tried to use them and nothing. They won't turn on. I tried contacting Cowin today, and yes, I know we're in a pandemic, but there was no answer and the voicemail was full. I did find a form on the website to fill out. Hopefully I'll hear from them and they'll do me a solid and replace them for me. They're only a couple weeks out of warranty. I would expect $90 headphones (what I paid for them last year) would last longer than a year. We're quarantined and I don't have any decent headphones to listen to music. Cowin, please come through.",3.0,negative
"April 13, 2020",Great headphone at unbeatable price!,"Purchased these headphones for long flights to cancel out humming of plane, people in background, watch movies/listen to music peacefully.

These are so much more comfortable than the previous pair, and the sound quality is just as good or maybe better than the higher priced product they replaced. While I'm not an audiophile, I have sent back headphones that sounded tinny; these have a nice bass to them and I'm pleased with the sound quality on both music and podcasts. The noise cancelling mode works as well as the numerous pairs I've had. The over the ear style definitely works better for this purpose. I can recommend these headphones.",5.0,positive
"April 13, 2020",Great Customer Service,I ordered these headphone 2.5 months ago. The sound quality and noise cancelling  feature is great.

I also have used them for video meetings on Zoom and voice quality is good as well.The headphones stopped playing sound 2.5 months after purchase. I sent customer service an email. Received a response within hours. In the same day Cowin honored the warranty and I had a replacement delivered to my door 2 days from the time I initially emailed them about the issue. Great customer service and it was easy. Definitely recommend purchasing these headphones and specifically from Cowin to make sure your warranty is good.,5.0,positive

In the end the number of mechanical failures of the cord or frame practically eliminated all the products being offered.  Time will tell if this set will last.Additional pro for this product is the quick response of the Bluetooth.  I could not detect any latency, hence the TV speaker sound and the BT sound arrived at the same time.  The headset is large, perhaps a bit clunky but if it hold up well worth the size.Be assured if there are any issues this review will be updated.

"April 12, 2020",Kitty Keeps Her Home,"After going through several types of earbuds, and having my loving cat chew through the cords and pull of the bud, I tried wireless blue tooth. The first pair were wireless buds that sounded great. I feared losing one so I took those to my office and tried another pair of wired buds with intentions of not leaving them out for Kitty to get. Of course, after a month, I left them out and  sure enough one wire was chewed through. UUGG... I decided I would just go with an old fashioned over the head bulky headphone. I found these and they were Bluetooth wireless. This made me happy. Although they re over the head and big, they allow me to listen to what I want on my computer while hubby watches his movies on the tv. The loud parts of his moving no longer startle me as I don't hear them as much with these. The noise cancelation is ok but I can still hear things.The battery on this is well more than I expected. I stated like 30 hours. I got at least that. Its been a month since I've began using these and the battery just this morning gave me a warning to charge.",5.0,positive

"April 11, 2020",Great Sound and Very Comfortable,"I have been using these for almost three months now. I have used them on two cross country (U.S. East coast to West coast and back) flights, and they were superb. During one leg I was sitting right behind the jet motor, so I could still hear some noise from that, but it was bearable. Throughout the rest of the trip, the only thing I heard was my audiobook.The charge time/listen time is remarkable! Sometimes I forget to charge them at night, and they run through the entire next day with no problem.The Sound quality is really good. They can get quite bass heavy for the right type of music, but listening to folk and acoustic stuff is very pleasant and not heavy at all. I'm quite happy with the sound over a wide range of music and spoken word (audiobooks, lectures, etc).Finally, the comfort is far superior than anything I've worn. My ears are a little sensitive and get sore after long usage, but I have not had a problem with these at all. Not a single time have I needed to take them off for discomfort. Excellent!",5.0,positive

"April 11, 2020",INCLUDED WRONG USB CABLE...SO I CANT EVEN CHARGE IT FOR WIRELESS USE.,"I saw all the great reviews, so I ordered a pair.  Product arrived early.  I was super excited, as my purchase arrived today.  April 11, 2020.I am disappointed that the USB cable doesn't even fit.  I tried several times to insert the USB in for charging... shoving it and it won't fit.  I sure hope I didn't damage anything.  After closer inspection, I was sent the wrong USB cable.  It's not even the same inner shape fitting for the headphones....it must be for a another product sold by this company.  It came pre-charged so I was able to use it wirelessly....but once the battery runs out...I can't charge it because I don't have the correct USB cable.The whole purpose of my purchase was to use it wirelessly....so that's super disappointing.Also,It's not completely noise canceling...as I have used both settings...and can still hear things.  I'm going to use it today so I can completely evaluate it.UPDATE: 4/13/2020The sound on my headphones goes down..then back to normal..a few times while the music is playing.  Not sure why this is happening...but it has been doing that since I got them.Update April 30, 2020Would have been nice for customer service to reach out.  At any rate, I am now sending the headphones back for a refund.",1.0,negative

"April 11, 2020",Cowin E7s are a great set of headphones for the money,"I was skeptical when I ordered these headphones.  It seems like headphones come in 2 varieties:  Cheap in price = cheap in construction and performance or Expensive = Good or sometime excellent in construction and performance.I'm always disappointed with ""Cheap"" but never want to pay $200 for headphones so I was looking for something in the all elusive middle section which seems to be always a mixed bag of pros and cons.I saw a set of Cowin E7's on sale (last years model probably) on Amazon and decided to take a chance.I'm not an audiophile, but I do work in the voice-over industry and know quality when I hear it and see it.The first thing I noticed was that the E7 has a quality build.  It looks and has the feel of pro gear far above it's price point.  The ear cushions are soft and seem well made, as does the head band.  Everything about the build seems to have been worked out, save a few things that I'll point out in a pros and cons section at the end.The sound is very good indeed, for the price point.  I've heard better, sure, but for a bluetooth headphone, its performance is terrific. The range and dynamics are as good as some of the other reviews I read have mentioned.The bass, although not overwhelming on this model, is clear and precise as it seems are the other frequencies.The battery life is very good as well.  I have yet to find the far ends of it and I know I've used them for 10+ hours before recharging.I've only owned these for about 3 months as of this writing.  I throw them in my gym bag and use them while weight-lifting. They have held up so far and they have a 2 year warranty if you register them after purchase.Now to the pros and cons.Pros:Solid pro feeling in the build and presentation.Excellent quality sound for the price point that I paid (around $56 usd with tax)Excellent Battery life.You can also use a cable (provided) to plug into a device, but know that you still have to turn on the power.Cons:The head band is not very tight and because of the weight, they will slip when you lay down...in my case, not suitable for sit-ups or any bench work during weight lifting.They cannot be used for running or any kind of jogging or impact movement.  I imagine it is to do with the suspension of the speakers in the headphones.  There is a distinct thumping that makes use in impact exercise not pleasant.  Bicycle riding and smooth exercise use works fine.The Carrying bag that they come with is not big enough for the headphones and you have to cram them in.I'll be buying the carrying case that they sell for this reason.Bottom line:I'm impressed with this Cowin product and will most likely buy another and have suggested them to friends.  They are the best I've seen for the price and they fill a place in the market for those who like quality and don't buy into the hype of brands like Beats and others who's names carry hefty price tags.  I can only imagine that Cowin's top of the line products perform like the best for half the price and I may venture to find out if these hold up to my customary use for while.",4.0,positive

"May 8, 2020",Great Headphones for the Cost,"I wanted some noise cancelling headphones to use around the house that let me listen to podcasts, even if I'm vacuuming or washing dishes. These ones do the job. There are plenty of more expensive brands that cost $200-$400. These COWIN E7 headphones fit a balance in price (only $60) and functionality. In addition I can talk on the phone with them. The controls on the right side of the head set took me a couple days to get comfortable with just by feel. But after a little practice, it's easy to pause, play, skip, adjust the volume, or answer a phone call. If you're looking for sport headphones, these are too big for running. But I took them on a bike ride once and they worked fine. They are not quite as small and sleek as some higher-end ones, but they do the job. They cup around the ears and are comfortable.  I'm happy with my purchase. I gave 4 stars for sound quality because some times the  audio isn't perfect on phone calls.",5.0,positive

The first set I bought broke but I liked them enough to buy another pair. I was going to throw away the broken set but thought I'd try customer service. I sent a polite email, a copy of the receipt, and a couple of pictures.I got a return email from Cowin WITHIN 2 HOURS!!! They sent me a code for a new set of headphones IMMEDIATELY. I wish the whole world worked like this company does. Beyond being happy to get the broken headphones replaced, I'm really happy that there are companies like Cowin that truly care about how they do business. THANK YOU!Louis",5.0,positive

"April 10, 2020","No issues, great sound","I have had these for a month or so and love the quality and sound. I have a pair of Bose that I use on the airplanes so I can say the sound cancelling is pretty close to that. I haven't tried these on a plane yet though. But, just the everyday house noise is taken care of with these for sure. They are very comfortable on my ears. I even did a whole afternoon of yardwork with them on and was very comfortable and helped with the thatcher noise. I don't turn them up to drown out the yard equipment, that would be dangerous. But they did buffer the noise so much on a low setting that I had to lift one ear to make sure what was happening with my thatcher.  Connects to devices easily.",5.0,positive

Or you can get the Cowin e7s and get good quality sound and noise cancellation at a very reasonable price.  Music quality is good -- not symphony hall quality, but good enough.

Full disclosure: I have a lot of high end hearing loss.Noise canceling is within my expectations.A bit tight on the ears.My only problem is with the blutooth connection. I think it installed an audio control driver that kept my Windows 10 computer from shutting down; I removed the audio control driver and my Computer now shuts down again, but the headset's blutooth connection doesn't work. I could be wrong but I suspect they're related.",4.0,positive
"April 9, 2020",Broke at the hinge 6 months after had used them.,"They fit good, and sound is good, the noise cancelling ok if played loud. But  the hinge broke, most likely due to the plastic part that holds them together, was very careful with them, alway kept in cloth bag and rarely used. But I went to pick them up and put on and they snapped. Very disappointed, I really liked them compared to plain wired earplugs. I liked enough I bought the wireless ear buds too.",4.0,positive
"April 9, 2020",Incredible Headset for the Price (Crazy Long Battery),"I have had these headphones for about 3 months now, and they are incredible. A few key highlights:- Pairs easily with phones and laptops, though once in a while i do have to turn off and on when switching between devices. However, it connects within 2-3 seconds.- Range is pretty good. I can move into the next room (a few walls and about 20-30 feet away) before the connection begins to break up.- Noise cancelling is very good, but often don't even need it, because the physical ear covers muffle sounds so well.- Very comfortable. I wear and use these for 6-8 hours a day during work (especially during quarantine). When I take them off, no redness or sore spots.- The battery is incredible. I use these during work all day. I charge them about once a week or even less frequently. So give or take 60-90 hours between charge.- The microphone is as good as you'll get. Especially with VOIP and laptop conferencing, I come in very clear (better than my cell phone according to people I talk to).- Has option for audio jack connect. But don't need it really, since the battery lasts so long.- Oh and sound quality. Yeah, it's great.",5.0,positive

Comfort: I don't consider myself to have a big head but if I wear the headphones for over an hour or so it would start getting very uncomfortable and actually hurt my ears.2. Sound quality is nothing to write home about.

I actually bought these for voice dictation on the Mac. They work so well that I found myself using them to watch movies and videos on my phone too. I‚Äôve used these for hands free calling while at home. The noise cancelling works pretty good as it cancels out enough noise to let you relax. They aren‚Äôt ear muffs but they do the trick.They come packaged very nicely and I‚Äôm pretty glad to see a decent amount of metal on it.If you‚Äôre on the fence about buying them then  I recommend you try them.The only con is that my wife thought they were too bulky.
